0720=That's too cruel....{N}{W2}{LEADER}, go to the{N}harbor from the east side.{N}It's safer.{W1}
0721=That's all the info I can{N}give you about the mission.{W1}
0722=So, all we have to do is{N}find the evil Gizmo and{N}kill him.{W1}

0743=How?{W1}
0744=A historian named Hawel{N}lives northwest of Yeel.{W2}

0748=What should we do?{W1}
0749=Oh, yes!{W1}
0750=Ah, yes!{W1}

0753=You're the pupils of Astral.{N}I know of you, {LEADER}.{W2}
0754=I heard that you did a very{N}good job in the Ancient{N}Tower.{W1}
0755=Why don't you go to Yeel{N}and bring Hawel back here?{W2}
0756=I don't think this is a{N}difficult job.{N}Will you go?{W1}
0757=You refuse the King's{N}wish?!{N}Answer again!{W1}
0758=Thank you.{N}Depart to fetch Hawel{N}immediately.{W1}

0760=Welcome to Yeel.{W1}
0761=This village is peaceful{N}but boring.{W2}
0762=I'm tired of living in such a{N}rustic small village.{W1}
0763=There are no soldiers, no{N}rules, and no noise here.{W2}
0764=I don't understand those who{N}want to leave this town.{W1}
0765=Young people nowadays{N}don't know the value of peace.{W2}
0766=War is not fun, but they{N}think it is.{N}{W1}
0767=May I help you?{N}Oh, hi kids.{N}Hawel?{W2}
0768=Yes, I know him.{N}He's famous, and he's kind{N}of a screwball.{W2}
0769=He lives northwest{N}of this village.{N}You can't miss it.{W1}
0770=Bok-bok-bok...{N}...(scratch)....{W1}
0771=Cock-a-doodle-dooo....{W1}
0772=That's my hen!{N}Don't torment her!{W1}
0773=Oh, you came from{N}Granseal?{W2}
0774=My son is working in{N}Granseal.{N}Do you know him?{W1}
0775=Are you from Galam, too?{N}No?{W2}
0776=Many Galam soldiers asked{N}me where Hawel lives.{W2}
0777=Hawel, Hawel, Hawel!{N}Why is he so important?{N}He's just an old man.{W1}
0778=Soldiers are so cool!{N}That's neat armor!{W1}
0779=I once travelled to Galam{N}and saw Mr. {NAME;28} there.{W2}
0780=Mr. {NAME;28} is the leader{N}of the Galam Army, but he{N}is a very kind man.{W2}

0785=I am studying at his house.{N}Please follow me.{W1}
0786={CLEAR}{LEADER} decided to{N}follow {NAME;4}.{W1}{CLEAR}
0787=Sir Hawel lives just outside{N}of this village.{W1}
0788=Hawel is eccentric.{N}He seldom comes to this{N}village.{W2}
0789=Shhh...keep this a secret.{N}I like the boy who is always{N}with him.{W1}
0790=They say that Galam and{N}Granseal are at war!{W2}
0791=I love peace.{N}I love Yeel!{W1}
0792=You had better not return{N}to Granseal.{W2}
0793=You don't have to die at{N}your age.{W1}
0794=A war always takes place{N}so suddenly.{N}But we're neutral.{W1}
0795=Nobody has seen Hawel{N}since Galam soilders went{N}to see him.{W2}
0796=Was he...kidnapped?{N}Or...or...?{W1}
0797=I heard that you are being{N}pursued by Galam.{N}Are you a criminal?{W1}
0798=You're from Granseal!{N}Please, please tell my son{N}to come back!{W2}
0799=Where is he now?{N}What is he doing now?{W2}
0800=Ah, why did I let him{N}leave?{W1}
0801=That storm made me uneasy.{W2}
0802=But I didn't foresee a{N}war.{W1}
0803=Hawel must have been{N}killed by Galam....{W2}
0804=I wanted to be a soldier{N}like them.  I've changed my{N}mind.{W1}
0805={NAME;28}!  I saw him leading{N}his army!{W2}
0806=I thought Mr. {NAME;28} was{N}a gentleman....{W1}
0807=Yeel remains neutral.{N}We are pacifists.{W2}
0808=Fugitives from the war come{N}here to live in peace.{W2}
0809=Of course, we welcome you{N}and your people anytime.{W1}
0810=Meow!{W1}
0811=This is Hawel's house.{W1}
0812=Sir Hawel!{N}Granseal friends are here!{W1}
0813=Strange...{N}There's no answer.{W2}{N}Has he gone somewhere?{N}Well, why don't you wait{N}for him inside?{W1}
0814=Wh...who are you?{N}Oh, Sir Hawel!{W1}
0815=Oops!  You came back early!{W1}
0816=You!  What did you{N}do to Sir Hawel?!{W1}
0817=Ohhh...{NAME;4}....{W1}
0818=Sir...you're alive!{W1}
0819=...It's no use running after{N}them....{W1}
0820=Are you OK, sir?{N}Why did they do such a{N}cruel thing?{W1}
0821=They were Galam soldiers.{N}They demanded my notes on{N}Ground Seal.{W2}{N}They suddenly snatched at{N}them, and...(cough)...{W1}
0822=(Whisper)....{W1}
0823=Who...is...it?{N}What...did he...say?{W1}
0824=He's {LEADER} from{N}Granseal.  He said that{N}Ground Seal has opened.{W1}{N}And a serious disaster{N}took place!{W1}{N}He came to see you for{N}more information.{W1}
0825=What?!  The door opened?{N}Who broke the ancient{N}seal?! {W1}
0826=Calm down, sir.{N}Why are you so excited?{W1}
0827=(Cough, cough)...{NAME;4},{N}listen to me carefully.{N}Grans Island is lost!{W2}{N}That tower is the sacred{N}seal that confines a terrible{N}devil.{W2}{N}Two jewels...(cough)...{N}were...installed to...{W1}
0828=Stop talking, or you'll die.{W1}
0829=I'm almost dead anyway...{N}(cough)...(cough)....{W2}
0830={NAME;4}, look for the jewels...{N}to seal...ancient...{W1}
0831=Sir!  Sir Hawel!{N}Don't leave me alone!{N}Oh, no...!{W1}
0832=Sir Hawel passed away.{W2}{N}I'm going to seal the tower.{N}It's Sir Hawel's last wish.{W2}
0833={LEADER}, please!{N}His wish is related to{N}your mission, right?{W2}{N}Can you go with me and{N}seal the tower?{W1}
0834=Now, let's go to the{N}Ancient Shrine!{W1}
0835=This is the treasure room!{N}You may not pass!{W1}
0836=It's true that the messenger{N}met with an unnatural death.{W2}
0837=But, that doesn't mean that{N}Granseal did it....{W2}
0838=I don't understand.{N}Why is King Galam so{N}impatient?{W1}
0839=When the messenger was found{N}dead, the King suffured a{N}great deal of pain.{W2}
0840=Thank goodness, he{N}recovered quickly.{W2}
0841=It's Granseals fault!{W2}
0842=I believe in my King!{W1}
0843=Who are you, stranger?{N}What were you doing in the{N}basement?{W1}
0844=I saw them!  I saw them!{N}Many soldiers went through{N}the gate.{W2}
0845=Where were they going?{N}To Granseal?{W2}
0846=No way!  We are allies!{W1}
0847=Are you tourists?{N}From Granseal!  They say{N}it's a nice place.{W1}
0848=The area north of Galam is{N}a wasteland.{W2}
0849=I heard that many monsters{N}are wandering around there.{W1}
0850=The priest is out now.{N}Since he decided to marry{N}{NAME;25}, he has been{W2}{N}neglectful of his duties.{W1}
0851=I like trees!!{W1}
0852=Young men like you are{N}not my guests.{N}Go away!{W1}
0853=(Hiccup)...I...I want to go{N}on a trip around the world.{W2}
0854=But...(hiccup), the north{N}gate of Galam won't open.{W2}
0855=I don't want to live my{N}entire life on such a small{N}island.{W1}
0856=Sorry, we never open this{N}gate.{W1}
0857=I heard the Princess of{N}Granseal is very beautiful.{W2}
0858=I hope to see her someday.{W1}
0859=I'm writing in my diary.{W2}
0860=I'm writing about the day{N}
0861=when the war between Galam{N}and Granseal took place.{W1}
0862=A record must be kept.{W1}
0863=I want to be a fine{N}soldier like {NAME;28}{N}when I grow up.{W1}
0864=King Galam changed when the{N}messenger was found dead.{W2}
0865=He groaned and suddenly{N}opened his eyes!{W2}
0866=Terrible...so terrible!{N}His face was not human!{W2}
0867=I'm sorry!{N}Please forget about it!{W2}
0868=I don't want him to kill me!{W1}
0869=We have many people to{N}send to the jail today.{N}Why?
0870=Why, you're wearing a{N}beautiful jewel!  Wow!{N}Give it to me!{W1}
0871=The trader tried to remove{N}the jewel.{W1}
0872=I can't remove it!  Blast!{N}How did you attach it{N}so firmly?{W1}
0873=What should I do?{N}My mother is visiting{N}Granseal!{W2}
0874=I didn't know a war was{N}going to start!{W1}
0875=Are you new here?{W2}{N}I've never seen you before.{W2}
0876=Anyway, don't leave town.{N}The King ordered us to stop{N}anybody who tries to leave.{W1}
0877=Everything is rusty because{N}we have not used the bridge{N}for such a long time!{W2}
0878=Who are you?!{N}Civilians are not allowed{N}to come up here!{W1}
0879=Sorry, {LEADER}.{N}I'm going back to Roft.{N}I'm worried about Petro.{W1}
0880=Impossible!{N}Galam and Granseal are{N}allies!{W1}
0881=But it's true.  I'm a scholar.{N}I'm here because I tried{N}to stop him.{W1}
0882=I'm a leader of the Galam{N}Army.  I disagreed with{N}the war and now I'm here.{W2}
0883=What did your kingdom{N}do to Galam?{W2}
0884=What is the reason for this{N}war?{W1}
0885=What about Sir Hawel?{N}He was killed by Galam!{W2}
0886=What did Galam want?{N}What is Ground Seal?{W1}

0888=What is Ground Seal?{N}Please tell me!{W1}
0889=I heard King Galam say{N}those words.{W2}
0890=I just know that something{N}is being concealed.{W1}
0891=(Yawn){W1}
0892={LEADER}!{N}You finally woke up!{W2}
0893=We're talking about{N}Ground Seal.{N}Please, join in.{W1}
0894=You got a raw deal, huh?{N}The same thing happened to{N}the rat next door.{W1}
0895=Hey, {LEADER}!{N}King Galam also knows about{N}Ground Seal!{W1}
0896=Hey!  Don't interrupt!{N}Sit down next to me!{W1}
0897=There are a lot of Galam{N}soldiers upstairs.{N}You still want to go?{W1}
0898=You're so brave.{N}Good luck!{W1}
0899=Don't tell anybody{N}that I neglected my work.{N}If you do{D1}.{D1}.{D1}.{D1}I'll kill you!{W1}
0900=Oh, I'm so busy!{W1}
0901=What's wrong with the seal?{W1}
0902=Somebody broke the sacred{N}seal?{W1}
0903=We're not sure.{N}It seems that somebody{N}stole the two jewels.{W1}

0910=They took my jewels and{N}brought me here!{W1}
0911=They...they killed my{N}friends!{W1}
0912=Ouch!{N}I can hardly move.{W1}
0913=Stay here for a while.{N}You need to rest.{W1}
0914=What were we talking{N}about?{W2}
0915=Oh, yes.  Why is King Galam{N}interested in Ground Seal?{W1}
0916=Is it related to the opened{N}door?{W1}
0917=Hey!{W1}
0918=Does he want the jewels?{W1}
0919=What?{W1}
0920=The man that broke the seal{N}is to blame for everything!{W1}

0924=We can't stay here!{W2}
0925=We must escape!{W1}
0926=I know, but how can we{N}open that locked door?{W2}
0927=Oh, Galam is invading{N}Granseal while we're{N}sitting here!{W1}
0928=I'll open the door for you!{W1}
0929=Oh, yes!  You're a thief and{N}you can open locked doors.{W1}
0930=Yes, of course!{N}I'm the great thief, {NAME;5}!{W1}

0932=OK, it's done.{N}Hurry to your country and{N}save them!{W1}
0933=Thank you!{W2}
0934={LEADER}, let's get back{N}to Granseal!{W1}
0935=Why are you being so nice{N}to us?  You don't know us.{W1}

0938=I...ah...{W1}
0939=You are!{W2}
0940=Hey, you!{N}Do you know what you've done?{W1}
0941=A big problem was created{N}because you stole the{N}jewels!{W1}
0942=I know the thief {NAME;5}{N}always steals for poor{N}people, but you made a{W2}
0943=serious mistake this time!!{W2}
0944=All these disasters...{N}everything is YOUR fault!{W1}
0945=I didn't mean to...{W1}
0946=That's enough!{N}{LEADER}, let's go!{W1}
0947=Wait!{W1}
0948=You'll be captured if you go{N}that way.{W2}
0949=I know this castle very{N}well.  I know a short cut.{W1}
0950={NAME;5} pulls up some tiles{N}with a short wire.{W1}
0951=Now, go out through this{N}short cut!{W1}
0952=You're right.  I did it.{W2}
0953=But, I didn't know all this{N}would happen.{W2}
0954=Please take me with you.{W1}
0955={CLEAR}{LEADER} decides to take{N}{NAME;5} with him.{W1}{CLEAR}
0956=Thanks.  I promise to help{N}you.{W2}

0989=Wow, great jewel!{W1}

0997=Oh....{N}Go and save her....{W2}
0998=Sir Astral was right....{N}That's not my King.{N}That's a devil!{W2}
0999=Me?  I'm almost a goner.{N}A strange black cloud{N}enveloped me...(cough)....{W1}
1000=He's already dead.{N}{LEADER} feels regret.{W1}
1001=The town was destroyed{N}by the earthquake....{W1}
1002=It was big enough to cause{N}a tsunami!{W1}
1003=Leave port now!{N}Right now!{W1}
1004=Who are you?{N}Don't push me.{N}The ship is full!{W1}
1005=Ouch...{N}I have bruises everywhere!{W1}
1006=There is no room for you{N}here!{W1}
1007=Oh, my!  Granseal is{N}collapsing....{W1}
1008=Sire!  Sir Astral!{N}Glad to see you again!{N}Can we put out now?{W1}
1009={LEADER}, are you ready{N}to leave port?{W1}
1010=Then come back here very{N}soon.{W1}
1011=King Granseal!{N}Sir Astral...oh,{N}Minister!{W1}
1012=Everything is ready!{N}We can go anytime!{W1}
1013=OK.  Let's go!{W1}
1014=Weigh anchor!{W1}
1015=Sir Astral, where are we{N}headed?{W1}
1016=This earthquake must{N}have caused damage all{N}over the island.{W1}
1017=Maybe...to the east...to...{N}Oh, yes!  To the mainland!{W1}
1018=To Parmecia?!{N}Hmmmm....{W1}
1019=What?  To the mainland?{N}No!{W2}{N}What about Elis?!  No,{N}we'll stay here on Grans!{W1}
1020=It's too dangerous to stay{N}here.{N}Weigh anchor right now!{W1}
1021=Papa is out now.{W2}
1022=He ran outside to see{N}the bird.{W1}
1023=May I help...oh, sorry.{W2}
1024=Old habits die hard.{W1}
1025=You know, I never leave{N}my shop.{W2}
1026=I didn't know birds like{N}this existed!{W1}
1027={LEADER}!  Your father{N}was also very curious.{W2}
1028=He must be indigenous to{N}the mainland.{W1}
1029=What a big bird!{N}How beautiful!{N}It's legendary!{W1}
1030=Wow!  It's very big!{N}He doesn't wear anything!{W2}
1031=I've seen many animal-like{N}races here, but they all{N}wore clothes!{W1}
1032=Mmmmm!  He's shining.{N}Is this a bird or a god?{W1}
1033=Hey, why don't you touch it?{N}It may be a stuffed animal!{W1}
1034=I can't see!{N}I can't see!{W1}
1035=This is boring!{W1}
1036=I'll miss you, {LEADER}.{N}I must find another customer.{W1}
1037=My father said...you would{N}be a nice boy for me to{N}marry someday!{W2}
1038=Oh, it's embarrassing!{W1}
1039=You're leaving again?{N}Under King's order?{W2}
1040=Of course, I'll miss you,{N}but this'll be a good{N}experience for you.{W1}
1041={LEADER}, you look so sad.{W2}
1042=Are you going somewhere?{W1}
1043=I'd at least like to have{N}a roof.{W1}
1044=I can't make any decent{N}weapons now.{W2}
1045=I want to go back to{N}Grans....{W1}
1046=That's a phoenix!{N}I feel very lucky to{N}see him in my lifetime!{W1}
1047=This house will be completed{N}by the time you return.{W1}
1048=Shhh...{N}I'm hiding here.{N}It's a secret!{W1}
1049=Are you ready?!{N}Hey, did you see my friends?{W1}
1050=I'm looking towards the{N}north.{W2}
1051=The northern half of this{N}landmass is always cloudy.{W1}
1052=There is a village to the{N}east of here.{W2}
1053=But everybody jumps into a{N}house when I try to talk{N}to them....{W1}
1054=Are my friends still playing?{N}Nobody came to find me.{W1}
1055=Mmmmmm....{W1}
1056=The bird is gone.{N}Now, back to work!{W1}
1057=That was pretty fun!{N}I'm going home.{W1}
1058=It was surprising!{N}The bird spoke!{W1}
1059=See, that bird is special!{N}He belongs to a god!{W1}
1060=Oh, it's you, {LEADER}.{N}I'll never forget you.{N}Thanks for saving me!{W1}
1061=The Minister was upset...{W2}
1062=He looked at me scornfully.{N}I will be disciplined!{W1}
1063=Listen, I've invented{N}something!{N}An explosive!{W2}
1064=You can blow up the rocks{N}blocking the North Cave{N}with it!{W2}
1065=Ah...no you can't.{N}You'll be blown up too!{W1}
1066=A strange animal?{N}Really?{W1}
1067=Yeah!  It's a very big bird!{W1}
1068=People are surrounding the{N}bird.  Should we talk to it?{W2}
1069=It would be a good{N}opportunity.{W2}
1070=I'll go see the bird!{N}You tell the King about it!{W1}
1071=Oh, {LEADER}.{N}Good timing.{W2}
1072=There's a strange animal in{N}town.{W2}
1073=It's very exciting!{W1}
1074=Oooo...it's big!{N}I want to touch him!{W1}
1075=Ooops!{W1}
1076=Ha, ha!  You missed.{N}Let me try.{W1}
1077=Wow, he's fast!{W2}
1078=Hey, he's over there!{W1}
1079=OK, my turn!{W1}
1080=Gosh, he's quick!{W1}
1081=Stop!  Stop this!{W1}
1082=Amazing!  He speaks!{W1}
1083=Of course I do.{W2}
1084=Is this how you greet{N}strangers?{W1}
1085=Shut up, bird!{W1}
1086=How barbaric!{W2}
1087=I didn't know humans were{N}so impolite.{W1}
1088=What?{W1}
1089=Those boys are about to{N}hit the bird.{W1}
1090=Stop!{W1}
1091=What do you think you're{N}doing?{W1}
1092=I'm sorry.  I must apologize{N}for their actions.{W2}
1093=Welcome to Granseal.{N}I am the Minister.{W2}
1094=We just settled here.{N}We're strangers here.{W1}
1095=Ha, ha!  You're right.{W2}
1096=But, I'm very happy to meet{N}a man like you!{W1}
1097=Please stay here as long{N}as you like.{W2}
1098=Let me introduce you to{N}King Granseal.{N}Follow me, please.{W1}

1102=You're loved by everyone,{N}my son!{W1}
1103=You've grown up so quickly!{W1}
1104=We have various kinds of{N}weapons, thanks to the{N}trading.{W1}
1105=Disaster again?{W1}
1106=Hey, it's a nice house, isn't{N}it?{W1}
1107=Anything exciting?{W2}
1108=A war against the devils?{N}No, no!{N}I don't want to go.{W1}
1109=Welcome back, {LEADER}.{N}I know, you're going away{N}again soon.{W1}
1110=I've been watching the{N}northern sky.{W2}
1111=I saw something big fall{N}from the sky to the north.{W1}
1112=How have you been,{N}{LEADER}.{N}Oh, you look strong.{W1}
1113=I'm not allowed to go out{N}'cause it's so dangerous.{W1}
1114=Sir Astral forbids me to use{N}the dynamite.{W2}
1115=I need his permission to give{N}it to you.{W1}
1116=Sir Astral, may I give him{N}the dynamite?{W1}
1117=It's too dangerous to use it{N}as it is.{W2}
1118=We need some way to{N}detonate the dynamite{N}safely.{W1}
1119=Oh, that cannon would be{N}perfect!{W1}
1120=Sir Astral said it was OK!{N}Here is the explosive.{W1}
1121={LEADER} got the{N}dynamite.{W1}
1122=Please destroy the rocks{N}blocking the cave!{W1}
1123=Welcome back, {LEADER}!{N}I heard your journey was{N}hard.{W2}
1124=Sir Astral was right.{N}He said, you were coming{N}back soon.{W2}
1125=I'll go to the castle and tell{N}everyone!{W1}
1126=I finally found you.{N}You're {LEADER}, right?{W1}

1131=Please take me with you.{N}Please!{W1}
1132=This is not a sightseeing{N}trip, if you know what I{N}mean?{W1}
1133=Yes, I know.{N}I still want to go!{W1}
1134=OK, you look tough enough,{N}anyway.{W1}
1135=Oh, really?{N}Thank you very much!{W1}
1136=(Cough)...our town is being{N}rebuilt, as you can see.{W2}
1137=But, we will be better off{N}if there are no accidents.{W2}
1138=You're too young to spend{N}your time guarding our new{N}home.{W2}
1139=You are the soldiers of{N}Granseal!{W2}
1140=Do your best to improve our{N}new home!{W1}
1141=King Granseal!{W1}
1142=(Cough)...(cough)...{N}King Granseal!{W1}
1143=All the people of Granseal{N}have been working hard for{N}an entire year.{W2}

1149=Ummmm...OK, I got it.{W1}
1150=One year has passed since{N}we came here.{W2}
1151=The castle, the town...{N}everything is coming along{N}nicely.{W2}
1152=But we lack something.{N}What is it?  It's trading!{W2}
1153=We need to make alliances{N}with other towns.{W1}
1154=Indeed, indeed.{N}Thank you, sir!{W1}
1155=That's all for today.{N}You may go now.{W1}
1156=I feel Elis is still alive....{W2}
1157={LEADER}, please prepare{N}a ship for me.{W2}
1158=I would like to go back to{N}Grans to find her.{W1}
1159=Is everything OK,{N}{LEADER}?{W2}
1160=Can these young men guard{N}our new town?{W2}
1161=The King is no longer what{N}he was.{W1}
1162=Time goes by very quickly....{W2}
1163=Those two jewels around{N}your neck will always{N}remind me of that...!{W2}
1164=The chain is made of{N}Mithril.  It can't be cut!{W1}
1165=Oh, the King looks so sad.{W1}
1166=(Yaaawn)...Oh, excuse me.{N}I'm tired because of the{N}Minister.{W2}
1167=He and Sir Astral talk{N}late every night.{W1}
1168=I envy you, {LEADER}.{W2}
1169=You can act freely, even{N}in the castle.{W2}
1170=I have to stand here{N}everyday. {W1}
1171=At least there is no danger{N}in the castle.{W2}
1172=I've never seen such strange{N}races!{W1}
1173=I'm told to stand watch{N}here.{W2}
1174=But, look!  Nothing!{N}What am I watching?{W1}
1175=Tactical Base!{N}Ah, you knew that?{W1}
1176=I can't believe it!{N}This isn't Granseal!{W2}
1177=I want to go back to{N}Grans Island.{W1}
1178=Granseal Castle!{N}Hee, hee...I'm cool!{W1}
1179=You need permission to enter!{W2}
1180=I was told to say that,{N}but nobody ever comes!{W1}

1188={LEADER}, you can't{N}understand my regret....{W2}
1189=It was the last chance to see{N}Volcanon in my{N}lifetime!{W1}
1190={LEADER}, I expect{N}you to find a lot of{N}allies!{W1}
1191=Gee, Parmecia is full{N}of wonders!{W2}
1192=Phoenix, Volcanon...it's{N}like living a myth!{W1}
1193=Elis is alive.{N}I can feel it!{W1}
1194=The prosperity of Granseal{N}rests in your hands!{W1}
1195=While {LEADER} is away,{N}we'll guard the castle!{W1}
1196=Tactical Base!{N}Nobody has visited here{N}lately....{W1}
1197=I'll miss you, {LEADER}...{N}but do not worry!{W1}
1198=Are you a phoenix?{N}The legendary bird?{W1}
1199=Y...yeah, I'm a phoenix.{W2}
1200=But...legendary?{N}I don't know about that.{W1}
1201=You are legendary, {NAME;7}!{N}I read that a phoenix serves{N}a god.{W1}
1202=God?  Ah, Volcanon!{N}{NAME;10} calls him a god. {W2}
1203=As long as he watches over{N}us, nothing can break the{N}peace of Parmecia.{W1}
1204=Volcanon?  The great being{N}who created the Earth?{W2}
1205=Oh, this is the happiest day{N}of my life!{W1}
1206=Please let me go with you{N}and meet Volcanon!{W1}
1207=Ummm...OK.{W2}
1208=To tell the truth, I hurt{N}my wing during this trip.{W2}
1209=I stopped by here to ask{N}for help.{W2}
1210=But, I don't want to trouble{N}you....{W1}
1211=Don't worry.  These lads{N}love trouble.{W1}
1212={LEADER}!{W2}
1213=Why didn't you tell me you{N}were here?  Did you listen{N}to our conversation?{W2}
1214=You know, it's time for us to{N}set out!{W2}
1215=We're going to Mt. Volcano{N}with {NAME;7}.{N}It's in the far east!{W1}
1216=Sir Astral!{W1}
1217=You said, you're going too?{N}No!{W1}
1218=Wh...why not?{W1}
1219=We came here just a year{N}ago.{W2}
1220=We're still learning about{N}this country.  You're needed{N}here.{W1}
1221=He's right.  You must stay.{W1}
1222={LEADER}, please take your{N}party and go with{N}{NAME;7}.{W2}

1237={LEADER}, please find{N}the Princess.{W1}
1238=The King is unaware of{N}Sir Astral's idea.{W2}
1239=The most important thing is{N}to defeat the devils!{W1}
1240=How long should I keep{N}guard here?{W1}
1241=To Grans Island?  But, I{N}like Parmecia now!{W1}
1242=We'll guard Granseal while{N}you're away!{W1}
1243=Your pass, please!{W2}
1244=Of course, you don't have to{N}show one, {LEADER}!{N}Go ahead!{W1}
1245=Tactical Base!{N}Why don't you talk to your{N}friends, {LEADER}?{W1}
1246={LEADER}, you'll be{N}surprised to see the results{N}of my practice!{W1}

1252=Great job!{W1}
1253=I heard about everything{N}from Bedoe.{W2}
1254=I never imagined Zeon could{N}be revived!{W1}
1255=I understand that Volcanon{N}is angry.{W1}
1256=So Princess Elis must be...{W1}
1257=She's alive.{W1}
1258=What did you say?!{N}Is she alive?{W1}
1259=Y...yes!{W1}
1260=Is it true?{N}Is it true?!{W1}

1266=Amazing!{N}{LEADER}!  And {NAME;7}...{W1}
1267=you've experienced a great{N}deal.{W1}
1268=Hmmm...mmmm....{W1}
1269=Sir Astral?{W1}
1270=What should we do now?{W1}
1271=Easy, we have to defeat{N}Zeon and save Elis!{W1}
1272=Impossible!{W1}
1273=The King is right.{W1}
1274=What?{W1}
1275=Astral, thank you.{W2}
1276=What do we have to do first?{W1}
1277=We have to go to North{N}Parmecia.{W2}
1278=We'd better go and see the{N}storytellers in Tristan.{W1}
1279=Sir!{W1}
1280=Astral winks at the Minister{N}and smiles.{W1}
1281=It's an important job. Will{N}you allow me to go with{N}{LEADER}?{W1}
1282=Sure, sure!  Just bring{N}Elis back to me!{W1}
1283=Be careful, Astral.{W2}
1284=It's dangerous out there.{W1}
1285=I will!{W1}
1286={LEADER}.{W2}
1287=I'm going with you as an{N}adviser.{W1}
1288=Adviser Astral has joined the{N}force.
1289=We have to remove the rocks{N}blocking the passageway{N}leading to North Parmecia.{W2}{N}Maybe we can use an{N}explosive!{W1}
1290=One year has passed.{W1}
1291=Hmmm?{W1}
1292=You're a spy from the new{N}town, aren't you?{W1}
1293=You're back again!{N}Mayor!  Mayor!{W1}
1294=Who are you?{N}What are you?{W1}
1295=A group of soldiers were{N}just here.{W2}
1296=Soldiers must be waiting{N}beyond the gate.{N}Be careful!{W1}
1297=You're so persistent.{N}What do you want?!{W2}
1298=You suddenly appear in{N}Parmecia, and build a castle?{W2}
1299=I don't know who you are,{N}but all big cities like war!{W2}
1300=I've never seen such{N}impolite and violent guests!{W1}
1301=He's right!{W2}
1302=You came here to capture{N}Parmecia!{W1}
1303=We'll never obey you!{N}Go away!{W1}
1304=You talk too much!{W1}
1305=Hey, {LEADER}!{N}Why don't you say something?{W2}
1306=I can't stand this!{W1}
1307=Hey, you!  I think I{N}understand how you feel,{N}but listen to me!{W1}
1308=Why?{W1}
1309=I'm not from Granseal.{N}I just visited there....{W2}
1310=You think they came to{N}Parmecia to conquer it?{N}Well, you're wrong.{W2}
1311=They were forced to leave{N}their island due to a{N}disaster.{W2}
1312=They're good people!{N}You don't have to be so{N}paranoid!{W1}
1313=Who are you?{W1}
1314=I'm {NAME;7}!{N}I'm a phoenix that lives in{N}Mt. Volcano.{W1}
1315=A phoenix!{N}The legendary bird?{W1}

1319=Of course, we of Ribble{N}will become allies of{N}Granseal.{W2}
1320=I promise that we will{N}welcome you when you visit{N}us again!{W1}
1321=Our ancestors came from{N}Rune, a southern island,{N}long ago.{W2}
1322=Since then, we've travelled{N}up here.{W2}
1323=The mountains to the north{N}block our journey.{W2}
1324=Are you going to{N}Mt. Volcano?{N}That's {NAME;7}'s hometown?{W1}
1325=We won't hide from you{N}anymore.  Ribble has many{N}ancient ruins.{W1}
1326=Men are so selfish.{N}My husband has gone to the{N}east to work.  What about me?{W1}
1327=Keseran is a historian.{N}But Mr. {NAME;11} is smarter{N}than him!{W2}
1328=I saw a strange hollow in a{N}tree.  Does something go{N}there?{W2}
1329=Is what you're looking for in{N}Ribble?{W1}
1330=I can't find it!{W2}
1331=The hidden door to the{N}ancient ruins must be near{N}this tree!{W1}
1332=To Mt. Volcano?{W1}

1334=But, I don't recommend you{N}enter such a terrible place!{W1}
1335=We call it the Cave of{N}Darkness.  You can't see{N}anything inside.{W2}

1337=Paseran and I are pupils{N}of Mr. {NAME;11} of Hassan.{W2}
1338=The ancient ruins around here{N}are very interesting to us!{W2}
1339=We're sure there are ruins{N}under Ribble, but we can't{N}find the door?{W2}
1340=I'll find it before Paseran!{N}I think that tree has{N}something to do with it.{W1}

1365=Dr. {NAME;11} lives in the{N}house over there.{W2}

1379=Hmmm...and what happened{N}to Max?{W1}
1380=He wasn't found in Parmecia,{N}so maybe he went to Grans.{N}I'm not really sure.{W2}
1381=I think I'll take a nap{N}now.  Bye.{W1}
1382=(Sniff)...(sniff)...I smell{N}something old....{W1}

1404=Nobody but Volcanon can do{N}that!{W2}
1405=He has never before killed{N}birdmen, but...{W1}

1407=Stupid Polca kids!{W1}
1408=Polcan people are cowards that{N}live in peace.{W2}

1421=Through the cave?{N}Nobody has come to this{N}village since...{W2}
1422=Oh, you defeated that{N}hobgoblin?  Wow!{W2}
1423=Now we can use that tunnel{N}to travel between Polca and{N}the wilderness area!{W1}
1424=Breathe deeply....{W2}{N}Wonderful air, huh?{W1}
1425=In ancient times, there{N}were magic tunnels.{W2}{N}People traveled easily{N}through the tunnels.{W1}
1426=To the east is the sacred{N}area of Volcanon.{W1}
1427=Mt. Volcano is home to{N}beastmen.{W2}{N}We were a warlike tribe, but{N}we've almost forgotten how{N}to fight.{W1}
1428=Young men these days are{N}lucky!  I wish I was young{N}again!{W1}
1429=You're not aware, but{N}Volcanon has become{N}irritated...{W1}
1430=...like that!  And, it's getting{N}worse.{N}What's wrong you ask?{W1}
1431=Whoa!  Mt. Volcano erupted!{W2}
1432=It's an evil omen.{W1}
1433=Clank!  Clank!{N}All of our weapons are made{N}by me!{W2}{N}But, who uses them in this{N}peaceful country?{W1}
1434=Hirsute?  'Cause I'm a{N}beastman.{W2}{N}I'm not hairy enough though.{N}I envy those hairy guys!{W1}
1435=Help!  Help!{N}I can't...get up!{W2}{N}You, please turn me over!{W1}
1436=Are you a wimp?{N}Push harder!{W1}

1440=They say, a huge monster{N}lives in the river.{W1}
1441=You saw Volcanon?{N}Are you serious?{W2}{N}I've never met him, though{N}I've lived here all my life.{W1}
1442=There's a desert in the south.{W2}{N}Ancient ruins lay in the{N}desert.{W1}
1443=I could help you if I were{N}younger.{W2}{N}But now I'm too darn old.{N}Drat!{W1}
1444=Before we knew...we tried{N}to avoid the fighting....{W1}
1445=Clank!  Clank!{W2}{N}I heard that blacksmiths in{N}ancient times made special{N}weapons from a rare metal.{W1}
1446=I need more hair and more{N}courage!{W2}{N}I couldn't move when I{N}saw the devils....{W1}
1447=Who are you?{N}Excuse me, but...{N}I'm blind.{W1}
1448=Pl...please...take that boy{N}with you!{W1}
1449=Ddddd...don't kill me!{W1}
1450=Please, take him!{W1}

1454=Good heavens!{N}He's badly injured!{W1}
1455=Mayor, mayor!{W1}
1456=What's all this noise?{W1}
1457=Mayor, a boy from the mountain{N}is seriously injured!{W1}
1458=What?!{W1}
1459=Ohhh...his eyes are{N}seriously damaged!{W2}
1460=He must have been caught{N}in the eruption....{W1}
1461=He needs prompt treatment!{W1}
1462=Yes!  Bring him into my house!{W1}
1463=Oh, this is serious!{N}I hope he survives the night.{W1}
1464=Ah...stop...no!{N}I don't want...to see....{N}My...head...aches....{W1}
1465=He came down from the{N}mountain....{W2}
1466=He's not from Polca, or{N}Bedoe....{W2}
1467=Where did he come from?{W1}
1468=Bedoe soldiers are cowards!{W1}
1469=Be quiet!{W1}
1470=My comrades!{W1}
1471=You're our captive.  Don't{N}force me to kill you.{W1}
1472=No more funny business, you{N}can't resist us!{W2}
1473=Now, give me that injured{N}boy!{W1}

1479=I came here to get a raft{N}for you.{W2}
1480=The people of Polca are{N}being controlled by these{N}devils.  They deceived me!{W1}
1481=Prince {NAME;10}, I'm sorry.{W1}
1482=Polcans will not fight.{N}Please let me join you!{W1}
1483=Great!{W1}
1484=Don't forget me!{W1}

1487=Heeeeee!{W1}
1488=I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!{N}Don't possess me!{W1}
1489=What's he talking about?{W1}
1490=I don't know...{N}What a loon!{W1}
1491=C'mon, mayor.  We're alive!{W1}
1492=What?!{W1}
1493=The mayor examines {NAME;10}{N}carefully.{W1}
1494=You're warm!  You're alive!{W1}
1495=I really regret all of this.{W2}
1496=Suddenly, the devils{N}appeared.{W2}
1497=We had no power to resist{N}them.{W2}
1498=They promised they would do{N}nothing if we gave Oddler{N}to them.{W1}
1499=And you sent ME in Oddler's{N}place?!{W1}
1500=I'm sorry, please don't{N}tell King Bedoe!{W1}
1501=Alright, I won't...{W2}
1502=If you prepare a raft for{N}{LEADER}.{W1}
1503=Oh, thank you!{N}A raft, OK.{W1}
1504=Hey, Ripster!{W1}
1505=Yes.{W1}
1506=Prepare a raft for{N}Prince {NAME;10}.{W1}
1507=But, it's the last one we{N}have...{W1}
1508=I don't care!{W2}
1509=You can make another if{N}necessary, can't you?!{W1}
1510=Y...yes, sir!{W1}
1511=A raft will be waiting for{N}you on the river.{W2}
1512=Why don't you take a look{N}at it right now?{W1}
1513=He wants to get rid of us.{W1}
1514=You're right.{W1}
1515=Anyway, now we have a raft!{W1}
1516=Let's go!{W1}
1517=Just a minute.{W1}
1518=If it's possible...{W1}
1519=Please take this boy with{N}you.{W1}
1520=You lazy human!{W2}
1521=You don't want to take care{N}of him!{W1}
1522=I...er....{W1}
1523={LEADER}, will you take{N}
1524=him with us?{W1}
1525=I agree.  Our journey will{N}be too difficult on him,{N}as he is blind.{W2}
1526=Mayor, we can't take him,{N}we're sorry.{W1}
1527=B...but....{W1}
1528=Are you serious?{N}{LEADER}, you're too nice.{W1}
1529=Oh, thank you!{W1}
1530=Oddler, {LEADER} will{N}take you.{W2}
1531=You can trust him!{W1}
1532=Thank you very much.{W1}
1533=Watch out!{W2}
1534=Be careful.{W1}
1535=Yes, I will....{W1}
1536=I'm Oddler.{N}I was nearly dead when I{N}came here.{W2}
1537=Actually, I don't remember....{W2}
1538=I don't know the reason why{N}the devils are after me.{W2}
1539=I'm afraid I'll cause you a{N}lot of trouble.{W1}
1540={LEADER} decides to{N}take Oddler with him.{W1}
1541=Wait, wait!{W1}
1542=Please, let me go with you!{W1}
1543=Huh?{W1}
1544=Watch out!{W2}
1545=Be careful.{W1}
1546=Yes, I will....{W1}
1547=As long as I'm here the{N}devils will return.{W2}
1548=Maybe {LEADER} is strong{N}enough to resist them?{W1}
1549=But, you may be injured!{W1}
1550=Well, I think he should come{N}with us.{W2}
1551=If we left him here, he{N}could be killed.{W2}
1552=It's too dangerous, isn't it,{N}{LEADER}?{W1}
1553=He needs a guardian.{W2}
1554=I'll take care of him.{W1}
1555=OK.  Let's go.{W1}
1556=Now, let's go to Devil's Tail{N}to see Creed!{W1}
1557=It sounds like {NAME;10} is{N}going with us.{W1}
1558=I am.  I want to fight with{N}{LEADER}.{W2}
1559=This might be exciting!{W1}
1560=I didn't know you were such{N}an adventurer!{W1}
1561=Alright!{N}Wow!  Let's go!{W1}
1562=The devils were almost{N}annihilated before.{N}
1563=Why did they attack Bedoe?{W1}
1564=Creed is the last greater{N}devil to survive the war.{W2}
1565=But he retired from the army{N}and now lives alone in{N}Devil's Tail.{W1}
1566=Uuuu...ooo....{N}He's...a...terrible...{W1}
1567=Oh, nightmares again.{W2}
1568=What did he see in that war?{W1}
1569=Mighty Volcanon!  He easily{N}defeated the greater devil!{W1}
1570=Ouch...the greater devil was{N}incredibly strong.{W2}
1571=But the other devils were{N}strong as well!{W1}
1572=They know that they can't{N}defeat our God.{W2}
1573=What was their true{N}purpose?{W1}
1574=Kneel before King Bedoe.{N}Just kidding.{W1}
1575=I protect the King!{W1}
1576=(Burp)...I'm not afraid{N}of devils...{W2}
1577=as long as I drink a{N}rootbeer first...(burp).{W1}
1578=They're neurotics!{W2}
1579=Everybody was shocked to{N}see the greater devil.{W1}
1580=Yes, they were strong.{N}But...{W2}
1581=Monsters like the Kraken and{N}Taros are much bigger!{W1}
1582=My spouse was...killed...{N}in the war....{W1}
1583=Zzzz...dad, no...come back...!{W1}
1584=The devils?!  I thought they{N}were only an old legend.{W1}
1585=I never let my hatchling{N}go out!{W1}
1586=Have you seen my dad?{N}Mom won't tell me anyhting{N}about him.{W1}
1587=We have a lot of weapons,{N}but I don't want to use any{N}of them!{W1}
1588=I'm bored!{N}I want to go out!{W2}
1589=How wonderful it would be to{N}fly on such a beautiful day!{W1}
1590=We need a lot of hot water{N}to treat these injured men.{W2}
1591=I've been standing here all{N}day!{W1}
1592=Huh?{W1}
1593=If...God Volcanon doesn't{N}calm down...{W1}
1594=Something happened in{N}North Parmecia.{W2}
1595=I saw a strange cloud!{W1}
1596=Goddess Mitula lives on the{N}north side of Tristan through{N}the mountains.{W2}
1597=The people living in Tristan{N}are kind, but weak.{N}I wonder if they are alright?{W1}
1598=We can't calm down{N}Volcanon.{W2}
1599=Without his protection, the{N}people that live on the{N}ground will perish.{W2}
1600=Only Tristan and Bedoe{N}will survive.{W1}
1601=Volcanon was very angry,{N}wasn't he?{W2}
1602=We can no longer depend on{N}him.  We must do it{N}ourselves!{W1}
1603=God Volcanon has forsaken{N}the people of the Earth.{W2}
1604=Are you going to kill Zeon{N}as he demanded?{W1}
1605=Then you may stay in Bedoe.{W2}
1606=You'll be safe here.{W1}
1607=You're a man of honor!{N}Why don't you go see Creed?{W2}
1608=He's an ex-greater devil.{N}He may give you some{N}information.{W2}
1609=You must travel along the{N}river to get to Creed's{N}mansion.{W2}
1610=Maybe Polca has a raft for{N}you.{W1}
1611=Tell the mayor to prepare a{N}raft.{W1}
1612=Yes, sir!{W1}
1613={NAME;7}, please{N}help {LEADER}.{W2}
1614={LEADER}, good luck!{W1}
1615=Shhhh!  My hatchling is{N}sleeping.  Quiet!{W1}
1616=Who are you?{W1}
1617=Bedoe is only for birdmen!{W1}
1618=Don't be so uppity!{W1}
1619=Oh, you're...{W1}
1620=Sir {NAME;7}!{N}Sorry, Sir {NAME;7}!{W2}
1621=Welcome back!{N}Volcanon is waiting!{W1}
1622=That's strange...{W2}
1623=I just realized...{N}Why are you flying guard?{W2}
1624=Did something happen?{W1}
1625=Well, the devils invaded{N}recently.{W1}
1626=Devils?{W1}
1627=Yes, the Devil Army.{W2}
1628=Strong greater devils broke{N}Volcanon's sacred barrier.{W2}
1629=But don't worry, Volcanon{N}defeated all the devils.{W1}
1630=The devils we fought must{N}have been part of that army!{W1}
1631=You met some other devils?{W1}
1632=Stop, stop!{W2}
1633=We already defeated them.{W1}
1634=That's great!  But...{W2}
1635=We'll go and make sure...{W1}
1636=Just in case.{W1}
1637=We're going to Polca Village{N}to patrol.{W2}
1638={NAME;7}, please see{N}King Bedoe.{W1}
1639={LEADER}, let's go.{W2}
1640=I'll introduce you to{N}King Bedoe.{W1}
1641=Yes, the greater devil was{N}very strong.{W1}
1642=But, God Volcanon swept{N}away all the devils.{W1}
1643=What about the greater{N}devil?{W1}
1644=He fled.{W1}
1645=Can't you track him?{W2}
1646=We must capture him before{N}he regains his strength.{W1}
1647=Did they come from Grans{N}Island?{W1}
1648=I think so.{W2}
1649=Maybe he died.{N}But beware of another attack.{W2}
1650=Watch carefully!{W1}
1651={NAME;7}, {NAME;7}!{W1}
1652={NAME;10}, how have you been?{W2}
1653=King Bedoe, you look well.{W1}
1654={NAME;7}, my friend, how{N}was your journey?{W1}
1655=Let me introduce my friend.{W1}
1656=This is {LEADER}.{N}He's from Grans and...{W1}
1657=I know.  He is a pupil of{N}Astral of Granseal.{W1}
1658=How do you know that?{W1}
1659=Sir Astral told me.{W1}
1660=What?!  Did you go to{N}Granseal?{W1}
1661=As Volcanon's messenger.{W1}
1662=And I heard that somebody{N}unsealed Zeon.{W2}
1663=Grans people caused a big,{N}big problem.{W2}
1664=Zeon might destroy the{N}world...{W1}
1665=Sorry to interrupt, but is{N}he that strong?{W1}
1666=Zeon is King of the Devils.{W1}
1667={NAME;7}, you had better{N}go see Volcanon.{W2}
1668=It may calm him down to see{N}{NAME;7}.{W1}
1669=Oh, is he angry?{N}Maybe later...{W1}
1670=Never mind later.{N}He has been waiting for you.{W1}
1671=Oh, yeah?  OK, I'm going.{W2}
1672={LEADER}, follow me.{W1}
1673={NAME;7}, are you taking{N}{LEADER} with you?{W1}
1674=Of course.  Why not?{W1}
1675=He thinks the people of{N}Granseal are...{W1}
1676=King Bedoe, I think{N}{LEADER} has to see{N}Volcanon.{W2}
1677=He should talk to him.{W1}
1678=Hmmm...you're right.{N}{NAME;7}, go ahead.{W1}
1679=OK.{N}Anyway, let's go.{W1}
1680=I had a dream last night.{N}I flew!{W2}
1681=Watch!  I can fly!{W1}
1682=Hmmm...strange...{W1}
1683=That didn't work.  Hee, hee.{W2}
1684=Stay there.{N}I know I can fly!{W1}
1685=See.  I told you!{N}I can fly...sort of.{W1}
1686=Ha, ha, ha!{W1}
1687=Ha, ha, ha!{W1}
1688=Oh my, {NAME;20}!{W1}
1689=Thank you!  Thank you!{N}{NAME;20} is OK.{W1}
1690=Welcome.  Travelers often{N}stop by here to rest.{W2}
1691=You may stay here as{N}long as you like.{W1}
1692=They say a fairy lives{N}around here.{N}Do you know her?{W1}
1693=Fairy?{W2}
1694=She has not returned{N}from Creed's mansion.{W1}
1695=To Creed Mansion?{N}Only the fairy knows how to{N}get there.{W2}
1696=But, maybe {NAME;13} knows{N}because he is a friend of{N}the fairy.{W1}
1697={NAME;13} is out.{N}He went to find the fairy{N}to help a sick dwarf.{W2}
1698=The forest to the west is{N}very dangerous.{W1}
1699=A forest elf always returns{N}one's kindness.{W2}
1700={LEADER}, I think{N}{NAME;13} will help you.{W1}
1701=Hey, you met Creed, didn't{N}you?{W1}
1702=The evil has completely{N}lifted from the forest.{W1}
1703=Is that sick dwarf better?{W2}
1704=Can he see the fairy now?{W1}
1705=We came from Grans to look{N}for Mithril.{W1}
1706=Recent earthquakes have{N}buried the tunnel.{W2}{N}My friend is sick now, and{N}we can't dig out the tunnel{N}without him.{W1}
1707=(Shiver)...cold...{N}Oh...I'm so cold....{W1}
1708=One of us went to look for{N}the fairy.{W2}{N}I hope he's alright.{W1}
1709=Dig, dig!{N}Hey hoo, hey hoo!{W2}{N}To Grans we are a diggin'!{N}Hey hoo, hey hoo!{W1}
1710=Hey, visit us in the Dwarven{N}Village when you come to{N}Grans!{W1}
1711=Where is the sick dwarf?{W1}
1712=Oh, thank goodness.{N}I sure am glad to see you.{W1}
1713=Here, please examine him.{W1}
1714=Oh, I hope I'm not too late.{W2}
1715=Ok, let's see.{W1}
1716=How is he?{W1}
1717=I don't know yet....{W1}
1718=Whoa!{W1}
1719=What?{W1}
1720=Hey, are you OK?{W1}
1721=I'm OK.  I'm fine.{N}I feel great!{W1}
1722=Oh, how can we thank you?{W1}
1723=I don't need anything.{W2}
1724=But, why don't you help{N}{LEADER}?{W1}
1725={LEADER}, I'm  going now.{W2}{N}I hope your journey is safe{N}and uneventful.  Bye!{W1}
1726=Thanks to you, he recovered.{W2}
1727=We all thank you.{N}Take this gift.{W1}
1728={LEADER} is given a{N}Cannon.{W1}
1729=Oh, your hands are full.{N}I'll give it to you later.{W1}
1730=We use it to destroy large{N}rocks.{W1}
1731=OK, guys!{N}Let's go back to Grans{N}Island!{W2}
1732=Everybody dig!{W1}
1733=(Sniff, sniff)...{N}It smells like a ditch!{W1}
1734=Is this the smell of the{N}devils that they were{N}talking about?{W1}
1735=Hee, hee!{W1}
1736=What huge rats!{W1}
1737=Welcome!{W2}
1738=It's dinner time!{W1}
1739=The Cotton Balloon popped.{W1}
1740=Ungh!{W2}
1741=It's too heavy. I can't{N}lift it.  I give up!{W1}
1742=You want to see Creed?{N}Are you serious?!{W2}
1743=A hole in the wall leads{N}to Creed, but don't use it!{W1}
1744=We came down here to{N}escape, but devils live in{N}the tunnel....{W2}
1745=They're too ferocious!{N}I'm gonna stay in Floor{N}World.{W1}
1746=We left Desktop Kingdom long{N}ago.{W2}
1747={NAME;16} is a brave leader.{N}We trust him!{W1}
1748=What happened?{W2}
1749=A strange feeling swept over{N}me when I entered that door.{W2}
1750=Then, it felt like...I was{N}lifted upward!{W1}
1751=It's very difficult to explain{N}what's happened to us....{W2}
1752=Anyway, we're very small now.{W1}
1753=Small?  How small?{W1}
1754=Let's see...now we're on a{N}desk...and it's very large,{N}like a village.{W1}
1755=Exactly.{W1}
1756=Goliath!{W2}
1757=Hey, what did you do to us?{W1}
1758=I told you not to go in{N}there.  You didn't listen{N}to my warning.{W2}
1759=You guys look so cute!{N}Ha, ha!{N}Bye, little kiddies!{W1}
1760={LEADER}, cheer up!{W2}
1761=Let's look around this{N}Desktop Kingdom.{W1}
1762=I agree!  We can meet Creed{N}later.{W1}
1763=??{W1}
1764=Hi, stranger!{N}How are you?{W2}
1765=Is it still beautiful outside?{N}I want to go.{W1}
1766=Creed is a fine gentleman.{W2}
1767=His magic saved us a long time{N}ago during a natural disaster.{W1}
1768=Devils cannot use their magic{N}to affect human lives.{W2}
1769=Supposedly, it's one of their{N}rules.{W1}
1770=This Kingdom was made by{N}Creed.  There's no concept{N}of TIME here.{W2}
1771=We never get old.{N}We never die.{N}What is the meaning of life?{W1}
1772=I was there during the{N}disaster.{W2}
1773=I was looking for the{N}legendary sword.{N}I hate it here!{W1}
1774=Are you from the outside?{N}Why did you come here?{W2}
1775=Ah, a mistake.  I see.{W2}
1776=I suggest you see King{N}Ponpei.{N}He's a good man.{W1}
1777=I'm sure King Ponpei will{N}help you.{W1}
1778=So, you were not able to see{N}Creed?{W2}
1779=Somewhere in Floor World,{N}there's a tunnel that leads{N}to Creed.{W2}
1780=OK, I'll let you go if you{N}win a game against my army.{W2}
1781=You may go to the chessboard{N}now.{W1}
1782=The army won't attack until{N}you reach the center of the{N}board.{W1}
1783=The Chess Army is very{N}strong.{W2}
1784=It will be good training for{N}you.{W1}
1785=Mr. Creed gave me this solid,{N}armored body!{W1}
1786=My attack power is the best{N}in the army!{W1}
1787=We knights are always ready{N}to fight!{W1}
1788=Is healing is my only ability?{N}Ha, ha!  You have a lot to{N}learn!{W1}
1789=I lead the army with the King.{W1}
1790=The Chess Army of Desktop{N}Kingdom is a well balanced{N}force!{W2}
1791=If it is King Ponpei's wish,{N}we will accept your{N}challenge!{W1}
1792=Are you ready?{W2}
1793=Now, start the battle!{N}Do your best!{W1}
1794=Checkmate!{N}This is for you.{W1}
1795=A Cotton Balloon is inside.{W2}
1796=With it you can leave{N}Desktop Kingdom safely.{N}Good luck!{W1}
1797=Bravo!  I'd give you an army{N}if you'd stay here.{W1}
1798=He's just kidding, but to{N}tell the truth, the Cotton{W2}
1799=Balloon is a very special{N}treasure.{W1}
1800=Some adventurers live in the{N}north-east part of Floor{W2}
1801=World.  Please visit them?{W1}
1802=Halt!  I can't let you{N}pass without the King's{N}permission.{W1}
1803=Floor World is very{N}dangerous.  Take care!{W1}
1804=You may go now.{N}I need to talk to fairy.{W1}
1805=Yes, sir.{W1}
1806=Tum-de-dum-dum.  Oh...{N}Time to check the{N}collections.{W1}
1807=Servant Goliath unlocks the{N}door.{W1}
1808=Excuse me.{W1}
1809=Yeow!{W1}
1810=Y...yes?{W1}
1811=We've come to see Mr. Creed.{W1}
1812=My master?{W2}
1813=Do you have an appointment?{W1}
1814=A what?{W1}
1815=No, not yet, but...{W1}
1816=I'm sorry, but he's busy now.{W2}
1817=Please come back later.{W1}
1818=We can't see Mr. Creed now.{W1}
1819=No kidding!{W2}
1820={LEADER}, {NAME;7}, let's{N}force our way into the room!{W1}
1821=Oddler, you're getting bold.{W2}
1822=But, it is a good idea.{W1}
1823=Hmmmph....{W1}
1824=Let's go!{W1}
1825=How did he do that?{W1}
1826=You impolite kids!{N}You can't go in!{W2}
1827=Mr. Creed is too busy!{N}Go away!{W1}
1828={LEADER}, on our left!{N}That door might lead to{N}Mr. Creed!{W2}
1829=Let's ditch this guy and go{N}through that door.{W1}
1830={LEADER}, let's do it!{N}I don't want to fail now!{W1}
1831=OK, OK.  We give up.{W2}
1832=We'll see Mr. Creed later.{N}Let's get out of here.{W1}
1833=Yeah, maybe later.{W1}
1834=No, don't go in there!{N}That door is...!{W1}
1835=What stupid kids!{W1}
1836=Whoever passes through this{N}magic door becomes small.{W2}
1837=That is, anybody who's not{N}protected by Mr. Creed.{W1}
1838=Goliath picks up{N}{LEADER}.{W1}
1839=Now, you're part of the{N}collection!{W1}
1840=Goliath...Goliath!{W1}
1841=Goliath!!!{W1}
1842=I'm here!  I'm coming!{W1}
1843=Yes, Mr. Creed?{W1}
1844=My collection is rather noisy{N}today.{W1}
1845=Oh, yes...ah...{W1}
1846=What?{W1}
1847=No, I...I added to your{N}collection today.{W1}
1848=You did what?!{W1}
1849=I'm sorry!{W2}
1850=I tried to stop them, but they{N}jumped through the magic door.{W1}
1851=You didn't lock the door, did{N}you?{W2}
1852=I told you to always lock{N}that door!{W1}
1853=Anyway, I want to see them.{W1}
1854=Right away, sir!{W1}
1855=What?{W1}
1856=Ah...{W1}
1857=I heard something.{W1}
1858=Are you Mr. Creed?{W1}
1859=Oh, someone from my{N}collection is talking!{W2}
1860=You must be one of the people{N}Goliath was talking about.{W1}
1861=We came to see you.{W2}
1862=Please return us to our{N}original size.{W1}
1863=You came to see me?{W2}
1864=Hmmm...why?{W1}
1865=Make us bigger.  My neck{N}hurts from looking up at you!{W1}
1866=Oh, sorry. {W1}
1867=Abra kadabra!  1-2-3!{W1}
1868=Wow, we're back to normal!{N}I can't believe we were so{N}small!{W1}
1869=Now, why did you want to see{N}me?{W1}
1870=Oh, yes!{N}We want to know about Zeon!{W1}
1871=Zeon?{W1}
1872=You said Zeon?{W1}
1873=The King of the Devils who is{N}sealed in Arc Valley?{W1}
1874=Did something happen to{N}Zeon?  Has he revived?{W1}
1875={LEADER} nods.{W1}
1876=No way!  You're kidding!{N}I can't believe it!{W1}
1877=Noisy fairy!{N}Be quiet!{W1}
1878=Is what you say true?{W1}
1879={LEADER} nods again.{W1}
1880=So, Zeon will appear again....{N}He will destroy everything.{W1}
1881=Sir, the new additions to{N}your collection are missing!{W1}
1882=I know.{W1}
1883=How...?{W1}
1884=It doesn't matter how!{N}Now, go away!{W1}
1885=Wow!  I can't believe this{N}is happening!{W1}
1886=You know, Grans Island is{N}covered by a dark cloud.{W2}
1887=At the same time, North{N}Parmecia has had no rain.{W2}
1888=South Parmecia is OK, but....{W1}
1889=That's because of Volcanon.{W2}
1890=I fear for Mitula....{W1}
1891=Volcanon and Mitula are{N}invulnerable to everything, {N}except Zeon!{W2}
1892=Indeed...Zeon is extremely{N}powerful!{W1}
1893=Zeon?  Oh, gosh!{W1}
1894=Goliath!  What are you still{N}doing here?!{W1}
1895=I have no time to scold you{N}now!{W2}
1896=The Evil Spirit may know{N}something.{W1}
1897=You guys, follow him.{N}Follow him!{W1}
1898=Maybe the Jewel of Evil has{N}a secret.{W2}
1899=Storytellers in Tristan might{N}know something.{W2}
1900=Tristan is in North Parmecia.{W1}
1901=Oh, is a dwarf sick?{N}Really?{W2}
1902=OK, I think I can help him.{N}Bring me to him.{W1}
1903={LEADER} decides to{N}take the fairy with him.{W1}
1904=Arc Valley was unsealed and{N}Zeon woke up?{W2}{N}This is a nightmare!{W1}
1905=My master would like to{N}help you, {LEADER}.{W2}
1906=Please choose one.{W1}
1907=I'm {NAME;14}, a knight.{N}I was looking for a magic{N}sword.{W2}
1908=I would do anything for{N}Mr. Creed!  Please choose me.{W1}
1909=What a pity...then, I wish{N}happiness to all of you.{W1}
1910=Hee, hee...I'm not only a{N}dwarf, I'm {NAME;16}.{W2}
1911=I'm known as the strongest{N}warrior of my people.{W1}
1912=Tut!  OK, I have a{N}comfortable life here.{W1}
1913=I'm {NAME;17}, a mage.{N}I studied magic in Ponpei.{W2}
1914=I'll miss my friends, but if{N}I can be of help, I'll go{N}with you!{W1}
1915=My magic could've been a{N}great help to you.{W1}
1916=I'm {NAME;15}, a priest.{N}I think I'm rather young{N}for my profession....{W2}
1917=I don't want to stay in this{N}awful place forever.{N}Choose me!{W1}
1918=You...snot nose!{W1}
1919=Hey, you're going east,{N}right?{N}I'm going with you!{W1}
1920=I really want to find the{N}legendary magic sword....{W2}
1921=But I can't do that if I'm{N}stuck here.{W2}{N}May I join your force?{W1}
1922=No?  Then I'll continue my{N}search for the legendary{N}magic sword alone.{W1}
1923=I was surprised to find I{N}had returned to my original{N}size!{W2}
1924=What should I do now?{N}I can go anywhere...{N}maybe...with you?{W1}
1925=Fine!  I'll stay in this{N}mansion then.{W1}
1926=I'm not sure why, but I'm{N}free.{W2}
1927=Can I join your force?{W1}
1928=You may regret refusing me.{W1}
1929=I'm free!  Fresh air smells{N}so good!{W2}
1930=Where should I go?{N}Hey, may I go with you?{W1}
1931=Why, how rude!{W1}
1932=Oddler?{W1}
1933=I understand you.{W1}
1934=Understand what?{W1}
1935=Oddler will remain here.{W2}
1936=Won't you, Oddler?{W1}
1937=Oddler, is this true?{W1}
1938=I don't know why, but I{N}would like to stay.{W2}
1939=No, I must stay here....{N}I must stay here....{W1}
1940=He's weak.{W2}
1941=He had better stay.{N}Say farewell.{W1}
1942=It was great travelling with{N}you {LEADER}.{W2}
1943=Thank you.  Please be{N}careful.{W1}
1944={LEADER}, you'll learn{N}the reason why he has to stay{N}here soon enough.{W2}
1945=Don't think about it now.{N}Go to the north.{W1}
1946=We devils can't help you.{W2}
1947=People of the Earth have{N}to seal Zeon again by{N}themselves.{W1}
1948=Hello, {LEADER}.{N}How are you?{W2}
1949=I'm well...but, I've had a{N}bad headache lately.{W1}
1950=Is he getting back his{N}memory yet?{W2}
1951=He's suffering from a very{N}bad headache.{W1}
1952=(Sob, sob){N}(Sob, sob){N}Oh, {LEADER}!{W2}
1953=Oddler regained his memory{N}and suddenly went berserk.{W2}
1954=He had a fearful face,{N}but my master seemed to{N}understand everything.{W2}
1955=He fell into the sea to stop{N}Oddler.{N}Is Mr. Creed still alive?{W1}
1956=Ketto is on the southern{N}edge of North Parmecia.{W1}
1957=Where did you come from,{N}boy?{W2}
1958=From South Parmecia?{N}Really?{W2}
1959=The tunnel to the south is{N}blocked.{W1}
1960=From South Parmecia?{N}Why did you come here?{W2}
1961=Pacalon has become isolated{N}since we opposed the devils.{W2}
1962=If I were you, I'd leave.{W1}
1963=It's unusually hot!{W2}
1964=Is Mitula as sick as I've{N}heard?{W1}
1965=The devils forbade us to go{N}out. {W1}
1966=Blast!  I hate devils....{W1}
1967=Ah, are you a customer?{N}Wow!{W2}
1968=It's a secret, OK?{N}I have very good weapons.{N}Hee, hee.{W2}
1969=Do you want to buy one?{N}Oh, you do?!  OK, come to my{N}shop!{W1}
1970=I'm a priest.{W2}
1971=Sorry, I can't open my{N}church for you.{N}Please understand.{W1}
1972=Hey, listen to me.{W1}
1973=Pacalon was always a good{N}customer for us!{N}They bought a lot!{W2}
1974=But, now we can't sell our{N}weapons because of the{N}devils!{W2}
1975=Annoying devils!{W1}
1976=Oh, sorry.{W2}
1977=I don't want to bother you.{W1}
1978=You again?{N}Bye now.{W1}
1979=Tristan is ruled by the{N}Goddess Mitula.{W2}
1980=So, we have no king.{W1}
1981=Devils?  They'd better not{N}come to Parmecia...{W2}
1982=as long as Mitula and{N}Volcanon are watching!{W1}
1983=I've not seen her here, but{N}she is in the shrine.{W2}
1984=Mitula Shrine is behind the{N}caverns of Tristan.{W1}
1985=Storytellers in the shrine{N}tell us the legends of the{N}world.{W2}
1986=Sometimes, it's difficult for{N}us to understand their true{N}meanings.{W1}
1987=It hasn't rained here lately?{N}No kidding!{W2}
1988=Everything is OK, as long as{N}Mitula is here.{W1}
1989=Oh, you're from South{N}Parmecia?  Welcome!{W2}
1990=The longer you stay, the more{N}you'll like it here!{W1}
1991=Hey, what happened here?{W2}
1992=We had many hopeful visitors{N}coming to see Mitula, but{N}now nobody comes!{W1}

2232=Anywhere.  There!{N}No!  There!{W1}
2233=But, the ship will be{N}destroyed!{W1}

2285=I think it's too dangerous{N}out there alone.{W1}
2286=And...{W2}
2287=It would be safer if we came{N}along.  Let's go.{W1}
2288=Look at that, {LEADER}!{N}They've finished breaking{N}up the ship.{W1}

2336=Ummm...I can't remove it!{N}Is it cursed?{W2}
2337=We'll go to the church{N}later to see if it's cursed.{N}At least we have it now.{W1}
2338=The knight said that King{N}Galam took the other jewel{N}with him.{W2}

2341=Let's go to Granseal!{W1}
2342=Halt!{W1}
2343=How did you get past the{N}Galam guards?{W1}
2344=No one is allowed to leave{N}'til we conquer Granseal!{W1}
2345=I know...ah...but...{N}King Galam...left this{N}behind.{W1}
2346=And you want to bring it to{N}him?  Hmmmm.  I don't know....{W1}
2347=What's going on here?{W1}
2348=They want to deliver a{N}package to the King.{W1}
2349=To King Galam?  It sounds{N}important.{W2}
2350=But he has not rescinded{N}his orders yet....{N}I had better deliver it.{W1}
2351=I'll get the package from{N}them.{W1}

2361=Father!{W1}
2362=King Granseal and{N}{LEADER}!{W1}
2363=Blast!{W2}
2364=Give up now, King Granseal!{N}Do you want her to die?!{W1}
2365=No!  You give up!{N}We've got reinforcements!{W2}
2366=Your great magic cannot{N}defeat all of our soldiers!{W1}
2367=I'll kill you before they{N}have a chance to attack!{W1}
2368=Just try it!{W1}
2369=Astral...{W1}
2370=Gguuu....{W1}

2378=What should I do?{N}{LEADER}, can you hear{N}me?{W1}
2379=Save her.{W1}
2380=I've no time to play with{N}these kids.{N}Devils!  I summon thee!{W1}
2381=Yeeeeee!{W1}

2385=King Galam!  You've lost{N}your followers!{W1}
2386=Princess Elis, come here.{N}Come here.{W1}

2396=King Galam murmurs a{N}magic spell.{W1}
2397=Watch out!{W1}
2398=What?!{W1}
2399=Father!{W1}
2400=Don't worry...I'm fine.{W1}
2401=That was just a warning!{N}Do you want me to attack{N}again?{W1}
2402=King Granseal...{W2}
2403=Galam, please tell me...{N}What's in this tower?{N}In Ground Seal?{W1}
2404=You really want to know?{N}Ha, ha!  OK, I'll tell you.{W1}
2405=King Galam displays the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
2406=I'll open the door to the{N}Evil World!{N}Observe!{W1}
2407=An earthquake!{W1}
2408=Now do you understand?  I{N}plan on opening the sealed{N}door!{W1}
2409=Why?  What's inside?{W1}
2410=You'll find out soon enough.{W1}
2411=What's he doing now??{W1}
2412=Here they come!{N}Ha, ha, ha!{W1}
2413=What?{W1}

2420=Minister, help me!{W1}
2421=Y...yes...but how?{W1}
2422=Throw {LEADER} towards{N}the light tubes!{W1}
2423={LEADER}, save her!{W1}
2424=Too late.  You're too late.{W1}
2425=Oops, we lost our grip!{N}But...{W1}
2426={LEADER} grasped the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
2427=What are you doing?{W2}
2428=Don't touch my jewel!{N}Don't touch it!{W1}
2429=I said, don't touch it!{W2}
2430=I'll shake you off!{W1}
2431=You're still there?{W1}
2432=Wow!  He's so brave.  Hmmm....{W1}
2433=I've almost got you now!{W1}
2434=No, you'll fall if you{N}open your hands now!{W1}
2435={LEADER}'s jewel suddenly{N}flared!{W1}
2436=Whoa!  The light...the{N}light!{W1}
2437=The Jewel of Evil fused{N}to {LEADER}'s neck.{W1}
2438=He stole my jewel!{W1}
2439=The two jewels merge{N}together.{W1}
2440=I have to go back and get{N}my jewel....{N}Noooooooo!{W1}
2441=Father...{N}{LEADER}...help meeeeee!{W1}
2442=She's gone....{N}Elis!{W1}
2443=We couldn't help the{N}Princess.{W1}
2444=(Sigh)....{W1}
2445={LEADER}, why do you{N}have two jewels?{W1}
2446={LEADER} explains{N}what happened.{W1}
2447=Indeed, perhaps...these{N}jewels are the key to{N}solving this....{W1}
2448=What?! Another earthquake?{W1}
2449=Wow!  It's getting worse!{W1}
2450=Whoa!{W1}
2451=Sssiirrr Astral!{N}What should we do?!{W1}
2452=I'm not sure.{W1}
2453=Sir Astral!{W1}
2454=Let's get out of here!{W2}
2455=We'll come back later with{N}soldiers to rescue her.{W1}
2456=But, Sir Astral...{W1}
2457=He won't budge.{N}We'll have to carry him.{W1}
2458=The Minister nods.{W1}
2459={LEADER}, you'll be{N}buried in the tower!{W2}
2460=Come on!{W1}
2461=It's over there!{N}There he is!{W1}
2462=He's lying down!  Why?{N}What happened?{W1}
2463=Hee, hee!  More strangers{N}have arrived!{W1}
2464=You!  Did you hurt him?{W1}
2465=This is my territory.{N}I protect it.{W2}
2466=You come here to save him?{N}Ha!{W1}
2467=Everybody, attack!{W1}
2468=Oh, my...hey!{N}Are you OK?!{W1}
2469=Oh!{W1}
2470=Oooh...unh...a big rock...{N}fell on me....{W1}
2471=Huh?  Where is it?{W1}
2472=It's...humph...{W1}
2473={LEADER}...how come{N}you're here?{W1}
2474=What a fool.{N}We came to help you!{W2}
2475=You would be dead if we{N}hadn't come.{W1}
2476=What are you talking about?{N}Oh, yeah!  I remember.{W2}
2477=A huge rock fell on me after{N}you left.{W2}
2478=It must have knocked me out.{N}Anyway, thank you.{W2}
2479=Look at that!{N}The tunnel is blocked by{N}a rockslide.{W1}
2480=Oh, what a pity.{N}Treasures may lie within....{W2}
2481=I guess we'll never know.{W1}
2482={LEADER}, let's go back{N}to the ship.{W1}
2483=You'll come to the foot of{N}Mt. Volcano through this{N}dark cave.{W2}
2484=But, I heard this cave is{N}home to a hobgoblin.{W1}
2485=Yes, it is!{W1}
2486=Wh...Who said that?{W1}
2487=Me!  The hobgoblin!{W1}
2488=Welcome to my home.{W2}
2489=Enjoy your visit because{N}you're not leaving!{W1}
2490=How can you...defeat...{N}devils?{W1}
2491=Ah!  You have the Jewel of{N}Evil around your neck.{W2}
2492=It's you, {LEADER}.{N}We've been waiting for you.{W1}
2493={LEADER}, did you hear{N}that?  He said, he had{N}been waiting for you.{W2}
2494=Why do the devils want you?{W1}
2495={NAME;10}, are you OK?  {NAME;10}!{W1}
2496=Squawk!  They knocked me{N}senseless.{W1}
2497=Where are the devils?{N}{LEADER}, did you defeat{N}them?{W2}
2498=Nobody in Bedoe can fight{N}like that.  Thank you.{W1}
2499=He's a great fighter.{N}Volcanon doesn't know how{N}good he is!{W1}
2500=He'll learn.{W2}
2501=Let's go see the mayor and{N}get a raft!{W1}
2502={CLEAR}{LEADER} decides to take{N}{NAME;10} the BDMN with him.{W1}{CLEAR}
2503=This is the Ancient Hall{N}that leads to the Ancient{N}Tunnel...{W1}
2504=There are more monsters here!{W2}
2505={LEADER}, take 'em out!{W1}
2506=It was lucky for me that I{N}met you.  Thank you.{W1}
2507=Follow me to the Ancient{N}Tunnel.{W1}
2508=Why is this door closed?{N}That's strange...{W2}
2509=Oh well, let's go in.{W1}
2510=What?  Let me try again.{W1}
2511=Petro, my grandson, locked{N}the door.{W1}
2512=Sorry, guys!  We can't go to{N}Grans Island this way.{W1}
2513=Huh?  The raft stopped!{W1}
2514=Did the water stop flowing?{N}What's happening?{W1}
2515=Wow!{D1}  What's that?{W1}
2516={LEADER}, look there!{W1}
2517=M...{D1}monster!{N}It appeared from the river!{W1}
2518=It must be the monster they{N}mentioned in Polca.{W2}
2519=Watch out!{W1}
2520=Stop!{W1}
2521=Who IS that big guy?{W1}
2522=Don't you know?{W1}
2523=That's Taros.  The guardian of{N}this ancient shrine.{W1}
2524=Again, stop right there, or{N}I'll attack you.{W1}
2525=What should we do?{W1}
2526=The Caravan is there, behind{N}him.  We must have it!{W1}
2527=Time's up!  Now we battle.{W1}
2528={LEADER}, you're much{N}stronger than I thought.{W1}
2529=It's so small.  I'll just{N}try to...get inside....{W1}
2530=Oh, he's gone!{W1}
2531=I hope he comes back.{N}Did {NAME;11} lie to us?{W1}
2532=I never lie!{W1}
2533=The Ancients were...how{N}should I say this...great!{W1}
2534=No wonder the Caravan is so{N}small.  It carries miniaturized{N}people and items.{W2}
2535=I can drive this excellent{N}vehicle.  May I go with you{N}as a driver?{W1}
2536={NAME;11} the historian{N}tags along with the force.{W1}
2537=You're kidding, right?{W1}
2538=Well, at least we can bring{N}a lot of soldiers with us.{W1}
2539=But soldiers in the Caravan{N}cannot enter battle 'cause{N}they've been miniaturized.{W1}
2540=We'll just have to see.{W1}
2541=Humph.  I don't like this guy.{W1}
2542=I wonder what adventures{N}we'll find with this Caravan!{W1}
2543=Wait!{W1}
2544=What's wrong, Oddler?{W1}
2545={LEADER}...{NAME;7}...can{N}you hear that?{W1}
2546=Hear what?{W1}
2547=I don't hear anything.{W1}
2548=Somebody is crying for help...{W2}
2549=from...over here.{W1}
2550=It's coming from this{N}direction.{W1}
2551=Look!  Over there!{W1}
2552=Help me!{W1}
2553=An...elven boy?{N}He's stuck in the pond.{W2}
2554=He must be very tired.{N}Let's pull him out.{W1}
2555=Did you come to help me?{N}Oh, thank you!{W2}
2556=I might have been eaten by{N}monsters if you hadn't come.{W1}
2557=My dinner is escaping!{W1}
2558=Who said that?{W1}
2559=That pond catches my food.{N}Hey elf boy, good trap, huh?{W2}
2560=Those who get stuck in the{N}pond are mine.  It's my{N}rule.{W1}
2561=Then, all the missing people{N}were eaten by you?{W1}
2562=They were in my pond.{W1}
2563=And this elf is my dinner{N}for tonight.  Got it?{W1}
2564=Did you guys bring the{N}ketchup? No? Oh, well.{W1}
2565={LEADER}, we have to{N}save him!{W1}
2566=I'm {NAME;13}, an archer.{N}I had no idea how dangerous{N}this pond was.{W2}
2567=You saved my life.{N}Thank you.{W1}
2568=You should thank Oddler.{W2}
2569=He heard your cry for help{N}and brought us here.{W1}
2570=Oh well, it was nothing.{W1}
2571=An elf always returns a{N}favor.{W2}
2572=Please, let me help you.{W1}
2573={LEADER}, looks like{N}we've found another friend.{W1}
2574=Oh, thank you!{W1}
2575=Now, let's go see Mr. Creed!{W1}
2576=(Sniff, sniff)...I smell{N}more invaders from the east.{W2}
2577=This is the territory of{N}Mr. Creed.{W1}
2578=Go away!{W1}
2579=But we have to see him.{W2}
2580=Please let us pass!{W1}
2581=No!  Leave now!{W1}
2582=Never mind.  Get 'em boys!{W1}
2583=Hurry!  Let's go into{N}Creed's mansion.{W1}
2584=Oddler, can you see?{W1}
2585=No, why?{W1}
2586=You're moving around as{N}if you can see.{W1}
2587=Am I?  Maybe my other{N}senses have sharpened{N}since I lost my sight.{W1}
2588=Oh, I see.{W1}
2589={LEADER}, let's go see{N}Mr. Creed!{W1}
2590=There's a wobbly rock.{W1}
2591=That rock looks{N}suspicious....{W1}
2592=Maybe {NAME;13} can{N}help us.{W1}
2593=Fairy said, move this rock{N}in this manner, and...{W1}
2594=Got it!  Thanks, fairy!{W1}
2595={LEADER}, come on.{W1}
2596=Answer me!{N}Where are you going?{W1}
2597=Ah...I...{W1}
2598=You were going to South{N}Parmecia to get help, right?{W1}
2599=I...uh...{W1}
2600=Paladins of Pacalon are{N}cowards!  {NAME;19}, don't{N}you have any pride?{W2}
2601=Wimp!{W1}
2602=Shut up!  Mr. {NAME;19} is{N}the bravest soldier in the{N}world!{W1}
2603=I can defend myself.{W1}
2604=Come on, you half-breed!{W1}
2605=Are you afraid of me?{N}I'll turn my back to you.{N}Now, run away you cowards!{W1}
2606=You've gone too far!{W1}
2607=Aaaauuuuu!{W1}
2608=Pacalon soldiers have no{N}honor.  They attack while{N}my back is turned!{W1}
2609=What?!{W2}
2610=If Mr. {NAME;19} was not{N}ill, you'd be history!{W1}
2611=Oh, is {NAME;19} ill?{W1}
2612=In that case, you can try{N}and take me.{W1}
2613=I can no longer put up with{N}these insults!{W1}
2614=No, no!{W1}
2615=Grruuu....{W1}
2616=You look so sad,{N}{NAME;19}....{W1}
2617=You're not just a normal{N}devil soldier.{W1}
2618=You're right, {NAME;19}.{N}I see why you're the leader{N}of the Pacalon Army.{W2}
2619=I'm Geshp!  An adviser for{N}Zeon!{W1}
2620=How did you know my name?{W1}
2621=I know everything.{W1}
2622=Now, tell me the reason why{N}
2623=you're keeping me alive.{W1}
2624=Ha, ha!  You're smart!{W1}
2625=What did you do?{W1}
2626=I...can't...!{N}My body won't...{W1}
2627=I came here to borrow your{N}body.{W2}
2628=Ha, ha!  Welcome our new{N}leader!{W1}
2629=Stop!!!{W1}
2630=Who said that?{W1}
2631=A force from the south?{N}How?{W2}
2632=Where did you come from?{W1}
2633=We're from Granseal!{W1}
2634=But, that's on the other....{W1}
2635=I'd better leave...{W2}
2636=Devil soldiers!  Stop that{N}force from Granseal!{W1}
2637=Is he alright?{W1}
2638=We have to save him before{N}he is possessed by an evil...{W1}
2639=What happened?{W2}
2640=Ah...I was almost possessed{N}by that devil.{W1}
2641=Thank you.{N}How can I repay you for{N}your kindness?{W1}
2642=Are you OK now?  Good.{W2}
2643=May I ask you, where were{N}you going in such a wounded{N}state?{W1}
2644=Pacalon, my country.  We{N}are fighting against the{N}devils.{W2}
2645=But, no country in North{N}Parmecia has enough power{N}to resist them.{W2}
2646=So, I was heading south to{N}find some allies.{W1}
2647=You don't have to go any{N}further.{W1}
2648=Then, you're from South{N}Parmecia?{W1}
2649=Yes, Granseal.{W1}
2650=Oh, how lucky!  Please{N}come with me to Pacalon!{W1}
2651=But, we have to go to{N}Tristan.{W1}
2652=Oh, please...I can't return{N}to Pacalon without allies.{W2}
2653=Maybe, when you're done...{W2}
2654=OK, I'll go with you.{W1}
2655=But, you're injured{N}Mr. {NAME;19}.{W1}
2656=No problem.  I don't know{N}why, but I'm much better.{W1}
2657=Let's go to Pacalon.{W1}
2658=Where did you come from?{N}What are you doing here?{W1}
2659=Don't you know about the{N}restrictions?{W1}
2660=Even if you didn't know,{N}that's just to bad.{W1}
2661=Wow, look at that?{W1}
2662=Those monsters are eating{N}the bridge.{W1}
2663=Help!  Help me!{W1}
2664=Look!{W2}
2665=She's stranded on the{N}bridge.{W1}
2666=Get away from the bridge{N}before it falls into the{N}river!{W1}
2667=I sprained my ankle!{N}Please help me!{W2}
2668=I can't stand up!{W1}
2669={LEADER}, defeat all the{N}monsters!  Hurry!{W1}
2670=Phew!  That was close!{W1}
2671=Thank you very much.{W2}
2672=Excuse me, will you help{N}me up?{W1}
2673=NO!  I'll do it!{W1}
2674=We'll take you with us.{W2}
2675=Tristan is the nearest town.{N}I think you had better rest{N}there.{W1}
2676=Thank you, sir.{W1}
2677=You sure are being nice.{N}Hmmm....{W2}
2678=Anyway, Tristan is just over{N}there.  Let's go.{W1}
2679={LEADER}...{NAME;7}...{W1}
2680=What?  Don't you want to{N}go to Tristan?{W1}
2681=Oh, I do, but...{W1}
2682=We shouldn't go to Tristan{N}right now.{W1}
2683=Why not?{W1}
2684=Because of me!{W1}
2685=Wh...who are you?!{W2}
2686=Are you a devil?{W1}
2687=I'm one of the leaders of{N}the Devil Army.{N}My name is Cameela!{W1}
2688=What do you want?{W1}
2689={LEADER}, I came here{N}to get your Jewel of Evil!{W1}
2690=Zeon told US to bring it to{N}the Ancient Tower.{N}He didn't mention you.{W2}
2691=And since we've never heard{N}of you, you're not getting{N}the jewel!{W1}
2692=No!  His orders were...{W1}
2693=If Zeon finds out, you will{N}be...{W1}
2694=He'll forgive me when I{N}bring him the jewel.{W2}
2695=Enough talking!  Hand over{N}that jewel.  In return, I'll{N}spare Sir Astral!{W2}
2696=Do you want me to kill this{N}old man?{W1}
2697=The jewel can't be removed{N}from {LEADER}'s neck.{W2}
2698=Do you really think that you{N}can kill me?{W1}
2699=Of course.{W1}
2700=HA!{W1}
2701=Ooops!{W1}
2702=Well done.  You dodged my{N}fireball.{W1}
2703=What a surprising old wizard!{W2}
2704=I didn't think I could obtain{N}the jewel that easily.{N}Ha, ha!{W2}
2705=This is gonna be fun!{N}{LEADER}!{N}Keep it for a while.{W1}
2706=Wait!{W1}
2707=Be careful of Geshp and{N}Zalbard!{W1}
2708=Ah, she's gone....{N}OK, {LEADER}.{N}Let's go to Tristan.{W1}
2709=Would you please explain{N}what just happened?{W1}
2710=You don't know?{W2}
2711=Everything here was set up{N}by Cameela.{W2}
2712=It was a trap to get the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
2713=Your fireball...as if you{N}knew what she was from the{N}beginning.{W1}
2714=Yes, I did.{W2}
2715=Her evil aura was apparent.{N}By the way, did you hear{N}what she said?{W2}
2716=They're all acting on their{N}own, ignoring Zeon's orders.{W2}
2717=It will be dangerous.{N}We must be careful.{W1}
2718=You can't enter Mitula{N}Shrine now.{W1}
2719=Sir Astral, what do we do{N}now?{W1}
2720=Hmmm....{W1}
2721={LEADER}, what do you{N}think?{W1}
2722=I'm not sure.{W1}
2723={LEADER}, it's obvious!{W1}
2724=I agree.  We have to see the{N}storytellers and listen to{N}the legends.{W2}
2725=Make a break for it!{W1}
2726=Wait, wait.  You must not{N}enter the holy shrine.{W2}
2727=So be it!  Let the truth be{N}known!{W1}
2728=Go away!  The devils already{N}occupy this shrine!{W1}
2729=Devils again!{W2}
2730={LEADER}, attack!{W1}
2731=Welcome, Granseal force!{W1}
2732=What?{W1}
2733=I heard a voice from the{N}other side of the door.{W1}
2734=I'm Zalbard.  I'm one of{N}the greater devils.{W1}
2735=Do come in.  Of course, you{N}can go back now and abandon{N}Mitula!{W1}
2736=Sir Astral...{W2}
2737=The greater devil that{N}attacked Bedoe was as{N}strong as Volcanon.{W1}
2738=Are you talking about{N}Sir Odd Eye?{W2}
2739=Did he fight against{N}Volcanon at Bedoe?{W1}
2740=Yes.  And he lost.{W1}
2741=I can't believe it!{N}Odd Eye is the strongest{N}devil among us.{W2}
2742=But, we haven't been able to{N}contact him lately.{W2}
2743=This is good news for me.{N}If I get the Jewel of Evil, I{N}can take his place.{W2}
2744=Now, enter the shrine.{N}Mitula is here.{W1}
2745=What should we do?{N}A greater devil awaits us{N}inside.{W1}
2746=Odd Eye...Odd Eye...{N}Odd...Eye....{W1}
2747=Sir Astral?{W1}
2748=I think I've heard that{N}name before....{W1}
2749=Sir Astral?{W1}
2750=Hmmmm....{W1}
2751=Sir Astral!!!{W1}
2752=Whhhhhhat?{N}{NAME;7}, don't scare me!{W1}
2753=What's wrong with you?{W2}
2754=Should we go into the shrine{N}now?{W1}
2755=Oh, sorry.{W1}
2756=Zalbard...at least he's not{N}as strong as Odd Eye.{W2}
2757=But still, he's a greater{N}devil.{W2}
2758=We had better complete our{N}preparations before we go in.{W1}
2759=OK.{W1}
2760=What a pleasure!{N}Nice to meet you.{W1}
2761=Ohhh....{N}He's ugly, isn't he?{W1}
2762=What?!{N}You dare insult me?!{W2}
2763=I've never...{N}For that you will die!{W1}
2764=Are you ready to die?{W1}
2765=Grrr...impossible!{N}Why...do I have to die?{W1}
2766=Where is Mitula?{W1}
2767=I don't know...haven't{N}seen her.{W1}
2768=Oops!  The Ground Orb....{W1}
2769=I can't endure the light....{N}Ohhh....{W1}
2770=Thanks to the Ground Orb, we{N}finally defeated Zalbard.{W2}
2771=The orb released holy power{N}in it's light.{W1}
2772=Hey, look over there!{W1}
2773=Welcome!{W1}
2774=Thank you.{W2}
2775=I've finally returned to this{N}world.{W1}
2776=Goddess Mitula?{W1}
2777=Oh, nice to meet you,{N}Sir Astral.{W1}
2778=Oh, you know my name?{N}Gee....{W2}
2779=Please tell us, what should{N}we do now?{W1}
2780=I don't know.{W1}
2781=What?!{W2}
2782=But, why?  You're a goddess.{N}You know our future, right?{W1}
2783=I'm not Volcanon.  I never{N}tell people the future, even{N}if it could prevent death.{W1}
2784=Death?!  Not ours I hope.{W1}
2785=Zeon is an unimaginably{N}strong devil.{W2}
2786=If he attains full power,{N}I, even Volcanon, would not{N}be able to stop him.{W1}
2787=So, we have to defeat him{N}before he revives completely.{W1}
2788=His power is sealed in the{N}Jewel of Evil.{W1}
2789=So, that's why he wants the{N}jewel!{W1}
2790=Then, why don't we keep the{N}jewel forever.{W1}
2791=Arc Valley is the place where{N}evil power gathers.{W2}
2792=He will recover his power{N}if he stays there long enough.{W1}
2793=Did you say, Arc Valley?{W1}
2794=You call it Ancient Tower{N}or Granseal.{W2}
2795=Granseal is named for the{N}symbol in the tower.{N}It seals the ground.{W1}
2796=I see.{W1}
2797=Goddess Mitula, where are{N}you going?{W1}
2798=Down to the surface.{N}To save the people.{W1}
2799=Are you going to abandon us,{N}as Volcanon did?{W1}
2800=Well...no.{N}I'll give you a hint.{W2}
2801=Listen to the legends from{N}the storytellers before you{N}go to Grans Island.{W1}
2802=You can't kill Zeon, but{N}Volcanon and I will help you{N}if you weaken him.{W2}
2803={LEADER}!{N}You are the chosen one.{N}You have the holy jewel.{W2}
2804=We need your help to reseal{N}Zeon.{N}Find the holy sword.{W1}
2805=Where is it?{N}How can we find it?{W1}
2806=It's on Grans.{N}Your jewel will lead you to...{W1}
2807=Mitula, Mitula!!{W1}
2808={LEADER}, Mitula{N}has vanished!{N}What should we do now?{W1}
2809=We have to go to Arc Valley{N}on Grans Island.{W2}
2810={LEADER}, find the{N}storytellers first.{W1}
2811=Finally, you've left the{N}castle, Vicar {NAME;22}.{W1}
2812=Geshp!{W1}
2813=So, you remember me. {W1}
2814=What do you want?{W1}
2815=I have plans for you.{W2}
2816=I'm very happy that you came{N}out of the castle.{W1}
2817=Why?{W1}
2818=I have been waiting for{N}{NAME;22}.{W2}
2819=Vicar {NAME;22}, you locked{N}the gate of Moun, remember?{W2}
2820=My faithful soldiers can't{N}enter Parmecia.{N}Now, you will open it!{W1}
2821=It's a trap!{W2}
2822={NAME;22}, run!{W1}
2823=Ha, ha.  He can't.{W1}
2824=Cameela!  Cameeeeeela!{W1}
2825=Cameela?!  We met her in{N}Pangoat Valley.{W1}
2826=What?{W1}
2827=Ah, Cameela.  You're here.{W2}
2828=Get the key for me!{W1}
2829=Geshp, you're as devious as{N}usual.{W1}
2830=That I am.  Now, get the key!{W1}
2831=Me?!  Why?{W1}
2832=Cameela!{W1}
2833=I hate you!{N}I won't help you.{W2}
2834=You want the key?{N}You get it!{N}You can use my army.{W2}
2835=See you later.{W1}
2836=That witch!{W2}
2837=Cameela!  Cameela!!{W1}
2838=They're divided....{W1}
2839=I don't need your help,{N}Cameela!{W2}
2840=Come on, devils!{N}Kill {LEADER} now!{W1}
2841=Bye, {LEADER}.{W1}
2842=You're not staying?{W1}
2843=I'm good at using my brains,{N}not my strength.{W2}
2844=I'll return by the time{N}you're defeated.{W1}
2845=I heard about you from{N}Geshp.{W1}
2846=He ordered me to take out{N}some of your people.{W2}
2847=But, it's not enough.{N}This is the end of your{N}resistance.{W1}
2848=Kill them, kill them all!{W1}
2849=I'm tired of this.  I can no{N}longer fight for devils.{W1}
2850={NAME;23}, what?{W1}
2851=Didn't you hear me?{W1}
2852=Hey, Granseal guys!{N}I'm on your side from now{N}on! OK?{W1}
2853=I can't believe it!{N}You might have been killed{N}by the devils.{W1}
2854=Indeed!  Why did you{N}change your mind?{W1}
2855=I'm {NAME;23}, from Galam.{N}I was waiting for the chance{N}to escape from them.{W2}
2856=I can't stand their wicked{N}ways!{W1}
2857=You have the same opinion{N}of them as we do.{W1}
2858=Please let me join you!{N}I could be a great help to{N}you.{W2}
2859=You need a professional{N}soldier like me.{W1}
2860=Oh, we welcome you.{W1}
2861=But, he was on the other{N}side just an minute ago.{W1}
2862=I don't care, {NAME;7}.{N}He has seen the error of his{N}ways.{W1}
2863={LEADER}, don't you want{N}{NAME;23} to join our{N}force?{W1}
2864=Oh, thank you!{W2}
2865=I'll try to do my best!{W1}
2866=I'm opening the gate of Moun.{N}Devils are waiting inside.{N}Be careful!{W1}
2867=Vicar {NAME;22} uses{N}the gate key.{W1}
2868=Welcome, losers!{W2}
2869=Will you follow the example{N}of the people of Moun and die{N}without resistance?{W1}
2870=No!  I'm too late.{N}I killed a lot of people.{W2}
2871=I can never forgive myself!{W1}
2872={LEADER}, please let me{N}fight with you.  They must{N}die!{W1}
2873={LEADER}, {NAME;22} will be{N}a great asset.{W1}
2874={NAME} returns to the{N}Caravan.{W1}
2875={LEADER}, {NAME;22} is{N}right.  They must die!{W1}
2876=There may be some survivors{N}somewhere.{W1}
2877=Do not touch my rock!{W1}
2878=Did you defeat all those{N}devils?{W2}
2879=I was wondering why it became{N}quiet so suddenly.{W1}
2880=Are you a survivor?{N}Are you from Moun?{N}What's your name?{W1}
2881=I am {NAME;26}.{N}I am not from Moun.{W1}
2882=Then, where are you from?{W1}
2883=The past.{W1}
2884=What do you mean?{W1}
2885=I cannot explain.{W2}
2886=I am what I am.{N}That is all that I am.{W1}
2887=I've never seen anyone like{N}you.{W2}
2888=Where are the people of{N}Moun?  Were there any{N}survivors?{W1}
2889=Some.{W1}
2890=That's good news.{W2}
2891=And where are they?{W1}
2892=Down here.  Follow me.{W1}
2893={LEADER}, hurry!{N}Follow {NAME;26}!{W2}
2894={NAME;26} knows where{N}they're hiding.{W1}
2895=Hello, Granseal soldiers.{W1}
2896=Remember?  I promised that I{N}would see you again.{W2}
2897=Come on.  Let's party!{W1}
2898=Stop!  You need my war plan!{W1}
2899=You again, Geshp?  Why don't{N}you leave me alone?{W1}
2900=Zeon left me in charge.{W2}
2901=It doesn't matter if you are{N}killed or not.{W1}
2902=Then kill me, if you've{N}got the guts to do it!{W2}
2903=I know.  You want me to be{N}die!{W1}
2904=Geshp, you coward!{N}I'll kill you first!{W1}
2905=I have no time to waste.{N}I must go.{W2}
2906=Silly Cameela.{N}You can't survive without my{N}brains.{W1}
2907={LEADER}, did you hear that?{N}He said you would win!{W2}
2908=He must be a bad{N}fortuneteller.{W1}
2909=We can get a ship and return{N}to Grans if we defeat her.{W2}
2910={LEADER}, get her!{W1}
2911={LEADER}, I lost?!{N}Take this.{W1}
2912=Cameela reveals the Sky Orb.{W1}
2913=This is the Sky Orb.  With{N}it, you can drive the Nazca{N}Ship.{W2}
2914=Listen.  You have to be very{N}careful from now on.{W2}
2915=Geshp has Prism Flowers.{N}He will...{W1}
2916=Your life is over,{N}Cameela!{W1}
2917=Geshp!{W1}
2918=Ha, ha, ha!  You acted just{N}as I planned!{W1}
2919=Ouuuuu...Ges...{W1}
2920=How horrible!{W1}
2921=It's the law.  Traitors{N}die by fire.{W2}
2922=Congratulations!{N}You have a ship now!{N}Come to Grans!{W2}
2923=I have to go now and{N}prepare your welcoming{N}party!{W1}
2924=I really hate him!{W2}
2925=Prism Flowers?{N}What are they?{W1}
2926=I have no idea, but it's{N}probably a trap.{W1}
2927=Ancient flower.{W1}
2928=Excuse me?{W1}
2929=Ancient countries had those{N}flowers along their borders.{W1}
2930=What kind of flowers are{N}they?{W1}
2931=I cannot explain....{W1}
2932=We will see them when we{N}arrive at Grans.{W1}
2933={LEADER}, grab the Sky{N}Orb.{N}Let's go.{W1}
2934=You're still alive?{W1}
2935=Geshp!{W1}
2936=Unbelievable!{N}You really are persistent.{W1}
2937=We'll never stop!{W2}
2938=We will not die until we{N}destroy all of you.{W1}
2939={LEADER}, kill him!{W2}
2940=We have to kill him now!{W1}
2941=I'm very sorry, but I have{N}to go.{W1}
2942=Don't let them advance!{W1}
2943=He escaped again!{W1}
2944=Geshp sure is a tricky{N}devil.{W2}
2945=After him, now!{W1}
2946=You're early!{N}{W2}
2947=Darn you, Granseal swine!{W2}
2948=But, don't worry.  I just{N}finished my preparations.{N}Yes...everything's ready.{W2}
2949=It's show time!{W1}
2950=Sir Astral, why is he smiling?{W1}
2951=He believes this is the place{N}where we will die....{W1}
2952={LEADER}, be careful!{W1}
2953=Prism Flowers?{W2}
2954=My Prism Flowers!{W1}
2955={LEADER}, I shall return{N}with Red Baron!{N}You'll pay for this!{W1}
2956=Now you shall pay for killing{N}my precious Prism Flowers.{W1}
2957=Geshp again.{W1}
2958=Hee, hee, hee.{W1}
2959=Do you have another cunning{N}trap for us?{W1}
2960=Would I do that?{W2}
2961=I just want to introduce you{N}to my friend.{W1}
2962=Red Baron, say hello!{W1}
2963=Grruuooouu!{W1}
2964=He's waiting for you just{N}outside the Galam gate.{W2}
2965=You have to defeat him if you{N}want to advance.{W2}
2966=See his red armor?{N}It's smeared with blood.{W2}
2967=He has killed many people.{W1}
2968=Now, it's your turn.{W2}
2969=This will be your undoing.{W1}
2970=Galam is just over there,{N}but...{W1}
2971=We have to advance.{N}{LEADER}, are you ready?{W1}
2972=Sir Astral, he's...crying!{W1}
2973=Why would he be crying?{W1}
2974=I think I've seen his style{N}of fighting before.{N}Let's see his face.{W1}
2975=Astral removes the mask.{W1}
2976=Huh?{W1}
2977=It's {NAME;28}!{W1}
2978=Let me see him.{W1}
2979=Wow, he's alive!{W1}
2980={NAME;28}!  {NAME;28}!{W1}
2981=Where?!{W1}
2982=What?!{W1}
2983=Oh, Sir Astral!  I had an{N}awful nightmare.{W2}
2984=I was controlled by someone{N}and I killed a lot of...{W1}
2985=It wasn't a dream.{W1}
2986=What?!{W1}
2987=You were being controlled{N}by a devil.{W2}
2988=And he made you kill every{N}person you saw.{W2}
2989=You recovered your senses{N}when we defeated the devils.{W1}
2990=I can't believe it!{N}I'm {NAME;28}, I'm...{W1}
2991=What can I do?{N}How can I atone for my sins?{W1}
2992=Sir Astral, tell me.{W1}
2993=You're not at fault.{W1}
2994=It's not your fault.{N}The devils are to blame.{W1}
2995=But...{W1}
2996=I have to die for my sins.{N}It will be my atonement.{W2}
2997=I have to die!{W1}
2998=Oh, poor {NAME;28}.{W1}
2999=Sir Astral, {NAME;28} has{N}fled. {W2}
3000=Will you let him die?{W1}
3001={NAME;28} is an immortal{N}vampire now.  He can't die{N}very easily.{W1}
3002=I think we'll meet him again.{N}{LEADER}, let's go.{W1}
3003=Stop!{W1}
3004=Finally, you've arrived.{W2}
3005=It was a mistake to{N}underestimate you.{W2}
3006=But, the game is not over.{N}At the risk of my life,{N}you'll proceed no further!{W1}
3007=Geshp is serious.{N}He finally considers us{N}worthy opponents.{W2}
3008={LEADER}, be careful.{N}We mustn't underrate his{N}power.{W1}
3009=You're right, Astral!{W2}
3010=Zeon doesn't trust me,{N}thanks to you!{W2}
3011=This is my last chance.{N}I can't see him again 'til I{N}bring him your head.{W1}
3012=My traps...{W1}
3013=I'm...at the end of my rope.{N}I...must...escape.{W1}
3014=Nooooooo!{W1}
3015=Please...please let me go.{W1}
3016=We don't want to kill{N}you.{N}You've lost your powers.{W1}
3017=I know...(sob, sob)....{W1}
3018=You may go.{W1}
3019=Thank you.{W1}
3020=I won't forget this.{W1}
3021=Where are you going, Geshp?{W1}
3022=Do you remember your vow?{W1}
3023=You failed to get the jewel{N}from {LEADER}.{W2}
3024=Now, you will pay with your{N}life.{W1}
3025=No, please...NO!{W1}
3026=Zeon is such an unfeeling{N}devil...(shiver).{W1}
3027=He will do the same to us{N}if we lose to him.{W1}
3028=We must not be defeated.{W1}
3029=I just heard that Geshp{N}lost.{W2}
3030=All greater devils have been{N}defeated except for Odd Eye.{W1}
3031=This is a good chance for us{N}to become greater devils!{W2}
3032=I'm sure Zeon will promote{N}us if we can get the jewel.{W1}
3033=Look over there!{W1}
3034=They're coming!{W1}
3035=Excellent!{N}Welcome to your graveyard!{W1}
3036={LEADER}, you're finally{N}here.{W1}
3037=Is that...?{W1}
3038=Did you forget about me,{N}{LEADER} and {NAME;7}!{W1}
3039=Oddler, are you Odd Eye?{N}Zalbard said...{W1}
3040=Yes, I am he.{W1}
3041=You're the leader of the Devil{N}Army who attacked Bedoe...{W1}
3042=Yes I am, Sir Astral.{W1}
3043=How do you know me?{W1}
3044={LEADER} told me about{N}you repeatedly.{W1}
3045=What do YOU want?{W1}
3046=Don't talk to me like that.{N}I'm very sad.{W1}
3047=Sad?{N}You've got to be joking!{W1}
3048=Well, yes I am.{N}I'm really quite evil.{W1}
3049=Don't you think so, Red{N}Baron?{W1}
3050=Uhh...(shiver).{W1}
3051=Anyway, I came here to{N}deliver an ultimatum.{W2}
3052=Think long and well before{N}answering me.{W2}
3053=Leave the jewel, your{N}weapons, and your items{N}here...or DIE!{W1}
3054=That means...we don't have{N}to fight him.{W1}
3055=True, but we can't take the{N}easy way out.  We mustn't{N}give him the jewel.{W1}
3056=You know how strong I am.{N}I think you had better{N}accept the offer.{W1}
3057=Hmmm....{W1}
3058=Oh, what should we do?!{W1}
3059=We have to fight!{W1}
3060=Times up!  We need space{N}to battle.{W1}
3061=I'm very sorry, {LEADER},{N}but I must kill you!{W1}
3062={LEADER}, are we really{N}going to fight Oddler?{W1}
3063=That's enough out of you!{W1}
3064={LEADER}, let's do it!{W1}
3065={LEADER}, you won?{N}You've become so strong.{W2}
3066=I knew you would....{W1}

3068=Your friends are very good.{N}I knew that when I was{N}traveling with you.{W2}
3069=Yes, it was interesting...{N}I miss that time....{W1}
3070=Odd Eye...no, Oddler!{N}Did you...?{W1}
3071=No, {NAME;7}.  I did my{N}best.  You were just better{N}than me.{W1}
3072=We had to be.{W1}
3073=I wouldn't have had to{N}fight if I never had gotten{N}my memory back.{W2}
3074=It's funny, fighting was{N}everything to me.{W1}
3075=Oddler, please don't die!{W1}
3076=Thank you, {NAME;7}.{N}I learned a lot from you.{W2}
3077=Oh, the pain!{N}Let me say good-bye.{W1}
3078=If possible, I want to{N}relive my life...not as{N}a devil...next time....{W1}
3079=(Sob, sob)...how sad.{N}{LEADER}, Sir Astral...{W1}
3080=Oddler had a pure spirit...{N}I'll miss him.{W1}
3081=Don't cry for him now.{N}This is Zeon's doing.{W1}
3082=We shall go onward and{N}remember Oddler in our{N}hearts.{W1}
3083=Who are you?!{N}Oh, are you from Granseal?{W1}
3084=But, Odd Eye went to...{W2}
3085=Impossible!{N}He was defeated?{W2}
3086=Inconceivable!  But...{N}OK, I'll stop you here.{W2}
3087=You shall die now!{W1}
3088=I can't see!  Is anybody{N}there?{W1}
3089=Welcome...{W1}

3098=So I came to welcome you for{N}him.{W1}
3099=She isn't moving!{N}Is she dead?{W1}
3100=We haven't killed her yet.{N}She will be the first{N}sacrifice for King Zeon.{W1}
3101=What?!{W2}
3102=Zeon said, you'd return her{N}in exchange for the jewel!{W1}
3103=Ha, ha, ha!  He lied.{W2}
3104=You killed our greater{N}devils.{N}I can't allow this to go on.{W2}
3105=You shall never see Zeon!{N}I'll kill you before that!{W1}
3106=Auuugh...{W1}
3107=I've never lost to anybody{N}but the gods.{W2}

3126=An earthquake!{N}Deep below us....{W1}
3127=Something is coming up{N}through the earth...{W1}
3128=I almost forgot...about...{N}the other devil....{W1}
3129=You mean...Zeon?{W1}
3130=Huh?{W1}
3131=Uh, oh.{W1}
3132=This doesn't look promising.{W1}
3133=Eeeekkk!{W1}
3134=Oh, no.{W1}
3135=Gggggrrr...you destroyed my{N}minions!{W1}
3136=Zeon!{W1}
3137=You resisted me....{W2}
3138=I...I never...!{W1}
3139={LEADER}, we had better{N}run away and return later.{W1}
3140=Sir Astral, we can't!{W1}
3141=Why not?{W1}
3142=Princess Elis fainted when{N}she saw Zeon.{W1}
3143=What?  Oh, my.{W1}
3144=And now we're surrounded{N}by devils.{W1}
3145={LEADER}, believe in your{N}sword and the jewel!{N}We must fight Zeon now!{W1}
3146=Let's go!{W1}
3147=Devils?{W2}
3148=They can't enter the shrine.{W1}
3149=This is a sacred area.{W2}
3150=Volcanon's shrine is here.{W1}
3151=God Volcanon!{N}I'm back!{W1}
3152=Welcome back, {NAME;7}.{N}You look well.{W1}
3153=Yes, I am!  This trip{N}was very interesting.{W1}
3154=That's good.{W2}
3155=What made it interesting?{W1}
3156=I met a lot people that live{N}on the ground.{W2}
3157=They help each other.{N}I made some friends.{W1}
3158=Wonderful.  It must've been{N}a good experience for you.{W1}
3159=I've brought a friend.{W1}
3160=This is {LEADER}.{N}He's from Granseal.{W1}
3161=Granseal!{W1}
3162=People of Grans Island{N}caused a serious, deadly{N}problem for the world!{W1}
3163=Volcanon?{W1}
3164=They awakened Zeon, the{N}legendary devil!{W2}
3165=I've been protecting all the{N}ground-dwelling people.{W2}
3166=I can't forgive them for{N}this!{W1}
3167=Volcanon, please calm down!{W2}
3168={LEADER} is not the person{N}who did it!{W1}
3169=Everybody who lives on the{N}ground is responsibile.{W2}
3170=They have to solve this by{N}themselves.{W1}
3171=What should {LEADER} do?{W1}
3172=My protection ceases now!{W2}
3173=He must face the devils on{N}his own.{W1}
3174=But...{W2}
3175=Even the greater devils{N}are as strong as you!{W1}
3176=If all the humans are{N}annihilated, that's OK.{N}It's their destiny.{W2}
3177=I want them to show me{N}courage.{W2}
3178=They must reseal the devil{N}again.{W1}
3179=Then, please give some{N}advice to {LEADER}.{W1}
3180={LEADER}, believe in the{N}power of the jewel.{W2}
3181=It belongs to both the{N}light and the darkness.{W2}
3182=It shows its true power{N}when the light and the{N}darkness are as one.{W2}
3183=You may go now.  I don't{N}want to see anybody until{N}Zeon is defeated.{W1}
3184=Volcanon!{W1}
3185={LEADER}, we'll defeat{N}that devil by ourselves!{W1}
3186=I didn't know he was such a{N}cold-hearted god.{W2}
3187=OK, I'll help you!  I'll{N}go with you to reseal the{N}devil!{W1}
3188=This shrine was built on top{N}of the mountain to watch{N}over everything.{W1}
3189=Do you know the legend{N}of the phoenix?{W1}
3190=And {NAME;7} was born from{N}holy fire.{W2}
3191=Volcanon is the highest{N}of gods and can revive{N}anything.{W2}
3192=Phoenix serve and work for{N}him.{N}They help the people.{W1}
3193=A phoenix is the legendary{N}bird who can't be killed.{W2}
3194=It is life itself.{W2}
3195=When his first life is{N}nearly over, he bursts into{N}holy fire to finish it.{W2}
3196=The fire creates another{N}life for the phoenix on the{N}ground.{W1}
3197=Stop!{W1}
3198=Who said that?{W1}
3199=Wow, what a huge guy!{W1}
3200=Leave here!{N}I'll attack you if you don't!{W1}
3201=Attack us?!  {LEADER},{N}let's get out of here!{W2}
3202=We don't want to fight him!{W1}
3203=OK, hurry!{W1}
3204=Are you ready?{W1}
3205=Good!  Now, let's go save{N}them.{N}Follow me!{W1}

3223=What did you find?{W1}
3224=The barrier around Grans{N}Island is too strong.{N}I can't see anything.{W1}
3225=Please try again!{W1}
3226=If I touch something of his,{N}maybe I could contact his{N}mind better....{W1}
3227={LEADER}, you have the{N}Jewel of Evil, right?{W1}
3228=Is this true, {LEADER}?{W2}
3229=That's one of the magic{N}jewels used to seal{N}Zeon.  Give it to me.{W1}
3230=But, we can't remove it.{W1}
3231=I can.{W1}
3232=Let me see it.{W1}
3233=Whhoooa!{W2}
3234=What's that light?{N}There are two!{W1}
3235=The other one is...{N}...ahhh...they called it,{N}the Jewel of Light.{W1}
3236=What?!{W2}
3237={LEADER}, do you have both{N}of the legendary jewels?{W2}
3238=I can't remove them.{N}The chain is made of Mithril.{W2}
3239=Show them to him.{N}They might help him.{W1}
3240={LEADER} displays the{N}jewels to Evil Spirit.{W1}
3241=Yeah, I feel it...I feel it...!{N}I think I can do it now.{N}Let me try again.{W1}

3247=Where are they heading?{W1}
3248=North Parmecia.{W1}
3249=Something has happened to{N}Mitula....{W1}
3250=I can't see Zeon.{W1}
3251=What do you mean?{W1}
3252=He's still in Arc Valley.{W2}
3253=He has revived, but he has{N}not recovered his full{N}strength yet.{W1}
3254=But, he has already created{N}
3255=a lot of mischief on the{N}ground...{W2}
3256=Is he that powerful?{W1}
3257=He is.{N}His power...{W1}
3258=His power what?{W1}
3259=Hi...s...pow...er...{W1}

3263=Ggggooo...I see a jewel.{N}The Jewel of Evil!{W1}
3264=He's seeing us through the{N}eyes of Evil Spirit!{W2}
3265=Impossible!{W1}
3266=You're {LEADER}.{N}I see you....{W2}
3267=Listen, {LEADER}.{N}Bring that jewel to Arc{N}Valley.{W1}
3268=Why should we?!{W1}
3269=I'll return Elis to you in{N}exchange for the jewel.{W2}
3270=Come to Arc Valley...{N}Ggggooo...!{W1}
3271=No!  Evil Spirit exploded!{W2}
3272=That's Zeon's power.{W2}
3273=If he revives fully, his{N}power will be unimaginably{N}strong!{W1}
3274=Creed, how reliable was he,{N}I mean, Evil Spirit?{W1}
3275=Very.{W2}
3276=Why does Zeon want the jewel?{W2}
3277=No more questions...{N}...without Evil Spirit....{W1}
3278=Creed?  Creed!{W2}

3282=It's been dry here since the{N}devils appeared.{W2}
3283=They must have done something{N}to Goddess Mitula!{W1}
3284=Brave Pacalons?{W2}
3285=None at all.  There are no{N}soldiers who can fight{N}against the devils.{W1}
3286=Devils are coming to town?{N}OK, I'll beat them up!{W1}
3287=Oh, I can't.  I'm too hungry!{W1}
3288=They came from Nazca, which{N}is west of Moun.{W2}
3289=We locked the gate of Moun{N}to stop their progress.{W2}
3290=Vicar {NAME;22} has the{N}key to open the gate.{W1}
3291=Devils came to Pacalon{N}through Moun.{W2}
3292=We blocked the invaders{N}by locking the gate of Moun.{W2}
3293=That means, we abandoned{N}the people living there.{W1}
3294=We don't have enough food{N}because of the long drought.{W2}
3295=Just one rainfall would make{N}us happy.{W1}
3296={NAME;19} asked you to drop{N}by here?  Thank you!{W2}
3297=May I ask you a favor?{N}Please save Mitula.{N}She's in Tristan.{W2}
3298=We will be ruined by the{N}drought long before the{N}devils destroy us.{W1}
3299=You'll see a route through{N}the mountains when you go{N}north from here.{W2}

3308=Thanks to the rain, I'm fine.{W1}
3309=The devils escaped when they{N}saw our soldiers. {W2}
3310=They're such chickens!{W1}
3311=Vicar {NAME;22} wants to go{N}to Moun and save the people.{W2}
3312=But, the devils will surge{N}into Parmecia as soon as{N}he opens the gate!{W1}
3313=I'm no longer thirsty,{N}but I'm not totally healthy{N}yet.{W1}
3314=Practice!  Who needs{N}practice?!  Ha!{W2}
3315=Oooh...I can't lift this{N}spear!{W1}
3316=I just saw a warrior who{N}came from the south a year{N}ago.{W2}
3317=He was shocked to find out{N}that the tunnel was blocked,{N}and went to Moun.{W1}
3318=Thank you, strangers!{N}You saved us!{W2}
3319=But I didn't think we would{N}be saved by humans!{W1}
3320=The King is a little upset.{W2}
3321=We've always believed that{N}centaurs were the best{N}warriors.{W2}
3322=But we were wrong.{N}I understand now.{W1}
3323=You defeated Zalbard and{N}saved Mitula.{W2}
3324=You are trustworthy{N}soldiers, so...would you{N}do me a favor?{W2}
3325=Please go to Moun with me.{W1}
3326=What are you going to do{N}there?{W1}
3327=I believe there are{N}survivors in Moun.{W2}
3328=I would like to save them.{W1}
3329=We have to go through Moun{N}to get to Nazka, right?{W2}
3330={LEADER}, let's go{N}together.{W1}

3332={LEADER} decides to take{N}{NAME;22} with him.{W1}
3333=Thank you very much.{W1}
3334=The Holy Sword is stuck{N}deeply into the rock.{W1}
3335=Sounds like something opened{N}somewhere.{W1}
3336=You got it!  All we have to{N}do is find the door to the{N}tower!{W1}
3337=The Jewel of Light begins{N}to glow.{W2}
3338=The light seems to pull{N}{LEADER}.{D3}
3339=The jewel glows even{N}brighter.{W1}

3342=Yes?{W1}
3343=You know about devices like{N}this, right?{W2}
3344={LEADER} has a cannon and{N}some dynamite here.  Can you{N}remove those rocks?{W1}
3345=Ah...OK, let me try.{W1}
3346={NAME;11} gets the dynamite{N}from {LEADER}.{W1}
3347=Stand back.  Ready?{W1}

3349=Wow!  This cannon is great!{W1}
3350=I can attend the battles{N}with this weapon.{W1}
3351={LEADER}, do you need{N}this any more?{W2}
3352=May I use it?  Huh?{W2}
3353=Wow, now I can fight along{N}side you!{W1}
3354=Please call me when you{N}need my help.{W1}
3355={NAME;11} is hooked.{N}Ha, ha!{W1}
3356=OK, {LEADER}.  Let's go{N}to North Parmecia!{W1}
3357=What?!  You forgot to bring{N}the {ITEM} with you?{N}{LEADER}, are you serious?{W2}
3358=You fool!  Go back and{N}bring it here!{W1}
3359=Ouch!  Hey, {NAME;26}!{N}I like your wild driving!{W2}
3360=Where's Sir Astral?{W1}
3361=Oh, there he is!{W1}
3362=Sir Astral!  Are you OK?{W1}
3363={LEADER}, come on!{W1}
3364=Was it...too wild?{W1}
3365=Phew!  We've made it to{N}Grans Island!{W1}
3366={LEADER}, Geshp's probably{N}coming for us!{W2}
3367=Evacuate the ship!{W1}
3368=What are you doing?{N}Get off the ship!{W2}
3369=I'll go first.{W1}
3370=We must finish our{N}preparations before Geshp{N}finds us.{W1}
3371=What a terrible waste.{N}We've lost an ancient{N}treasure.{W2}
3372=Anyway, we have to go to{N}Arc Valley.{N}{LEADER}, let's go.{W1}
3373={LEADER} tries to use{N}the {ITEM}.{W2}{N}But, he doesn't know how.{W1}
3374=Well, {LEADER}.  Let's go{N}back to look for someone{N}who knows about this ship.{W1}
3375={LEADER} fit the {ITEM}{N}into the cockpit.{W1}
3376=You can start the ship by{N}placing the Sky Orb into{N}the cockpit.{W1}
3377=Wow, the ship is vibrating!{W1}
3378=What's going on?{W1}
3379=Don't worry. {W1}
3380=But...but...{N}Woooooow!{W1}
3381=It's floating!  This big{N}ship is floating!{W1}
3382=We're going higher and{N}higher....{W1}
3383=I've never experienced{N}anything like this in my{N}seventy years of life!{W1}
3384=OK, now we'll head to{N}Grans Island.{W1}
3385=Oh, we're flying!{W1}
3386=The Ancients were greater{N}than we thought!{W1}
3387=Oh, thank you very much.{W1}
3388=I'm guilty!{W1}
3389=Hey, there's {NAME;28}.{W1}
3390=I've killed a lot of people{N}for the devils!{W2}
3391=The guilt is too much to{N}handle.  I must die!{W1}
3392=Gee!{N}{NAME;28} killed himself!{W1}
3393=No, {NAME;28} cannot die{N}by jumping off a cliff.{W2}
3394={NAME;28} is an immortal{N}vampire.{W2}
3395=But, I'm sure the impact{N}didn't feel too good.{W1}
3396=Ah, devils finally found the{N}hidden door.{W1}
3397=I must give the people time{N}to escape!{W1}
3398=The priest pulls out a holy{N}symbol.{W1}
3399=What's he doing?{W1}
3400=He's mistaking us for devils.{W1}
3401=What tough devils!{W2}
3402=My symbol doesn't drive{N}them away!{W1}
3403=Excuse me, we're not devils.{W1}
3404=I don't believe you!{W1}
3405=But we really...{W1}
3406=Brother?{W1}
3407={NAME;27}, they found the{N}hidden door!{W2}
3408=I tried to drive them away{N}with this holy symbol, but{N}I failed.{W1}
3409=Then, they're not devils.{W1}
3410=Nobody but devils ever come{N}to such a dangerous place!{N}They must be devils!{W1}
3411=Have you asked them?{W1}
3412=How can we explain this?{W2}
3413=We are from Granseal.{N}We came here to defeat the{N}devils.{W1}
3414=Granseal?{W1}
3415=Really?{W1}
3416=Alright!{W1}
3417=This is great news!{W1}
3418=Are you Sir Astral?{W1}
3419=Yes, but...I'm sorry, have{N}we met?{W1}
3420=I'm {NAME;27}, a son of{N}Hawel.{W2}
3421=Do you remember me?{W1}
3422=Hawel's son?{W1}
3423=Oh, {NAME;27}!{W2}
3424=Yes, of course.{N}Nice to see you again.{W2}
3425=What are you doing here?{W1}
3426=I came back to Yeel to{N}continue my father's work.{W1}
3427={NAME;27}, maybe you can{N}answer some questions?{W1}
3428=I'll try.{W2}
3429=What would you like to know?{W1}
3430=Oh, this will be a great{N}help!{W1}
3431=You can use the room below.{W1}
3432=Thank you very much.{W1}
3433=I really appreciate this.{W1}
3434=I heard you're going to{N}defeat the devils....{W1}
3435=Yep.  {LEADER} just{N}solved the secret.  We{N}can now enter the tower.{W1}
3436=The tower?{W2}
3437=Then, all these disasters{N}were caused by Zeon?{W1}
3438=Let me help you.{W1}
3439=I would like to give you{N}a hand.{W1}
3440=Oh, thank you.{W1}
3441=I appreciate your kindness.{W1}
3442=...and now we're here.{W1}
3443=Wow!  Your story is so{N}complicated.{W2}
3444=But, from what I understand,{N}Zeon is reviving.{W2}
3445=And all these disasters were{N}caused by him?{W1}
3446=That's right.  We have to{N}find out where the Holy{N}Sword is.{W1}
3447=I think I've seen it in a{N}book....{W2}
3448=Yes, I did...but...{N}I don't remember....{W1}
3449=It's important...{W1}
3450=Please, give me a moment.{W1}
3451=Was it this one?{W1}
3452=No, that's not it.{W1}
3453=How about this one?{W1}
3454=Yeah, I got it!{W1}
3455=Is that the right one?{W1}
3456=Yes!  But...{W1}
3457=But what?{W1}
3458=The most important part is{N}missing.  It's been stolen.{W1}
3459=Who could've taken it?{W2}
3460=Oh, we've lost the key.{W1}
3461=Not necessarily, Sir Astral.{W2}
3462=Believe in {LEADER}.{N}He was chosen by the gods.{W1}
3463=Hmmm....{W2}
3464=Yes, {NAME;7} is right.{N}{LEADER} is our leader!{W1}
3465={LEADER}, we have to{N}find the Holy Sword and{N}the door to the tower.{W2}
3466=The legends only hint of{N}you, but we believe in you.{W1}
3467=Believe in the power of{N}your jewel!{W1}
3468=Yes, that's the truth.{W1}
3469=Now, {LEADER}.{W1}
3470=We need to return and{N}restore world peace.{W1}
3471={LEADER}, would you mind{N}if I went with you?{W1}
3472=No, {NAME;27}.  You have{N}to continue your work.{W1}
3473=I knew you'd say that, but I{N}can't continue my work if{N}Zeon revives.{W2}
3474=Also, as a historian, I{N}want to see the King of{N}the Devils.{W1}
3475={NAME;27} will just follow{N}us if you don't let him{N}join us.{W1}
3476={NAME;7} is right.{W1}
3477=(Sigh)...OK.{W1}
3478=I'm so excited!{W1}
3479=This is not a sight-seeing{N}tour, OK?!{N}Let's go {LEADER}!{W1}
3480=It's a fine-looking piano.{N}Will you play it?{W1}
3481=Something opened somewhere.{W1}
3482={LEADER}, can't you play?{W1}
3483=I can't believe it!{N}I want to die, but I can't!{W1}
3484=A poster...{N}PULL IT!  PUSH IT!{W1}
3485=A book...{N}ANCIENT KINGDOMS{W1}
3486=A book...{N}CIVILIZATIONS{W1}
3487=A book...{N}THE ANCIENT TOWER{W1}
3488=Red Baron is {NAME;28}.{W2}
3489=He was running around and{N}crying for somebody to kill{N}him.{W1}
3490={NAME;28} went south.{N}He was acting strange.{W1}
3491=King Galam has not returned{N}from the war against{N}Granseal.{W1}
3492={NAME;28} made that hole.{W2}
3493=He jumped off the top of the{N}castle, but he didn't die!{W1}
3494=My boyfriend has not{N}returned from the war...{W2}
3495=I hope he's alive...{W1}
3496=I heard from a soldier that{N}Yeel is haunted.{W2}
3497=He said that he heard the{N}sound of a piano playing.{W1}
3498=From Granseal?  I didn't{N}know anyone survived that{N}earthquake.{W1}
3499=The priest of Yeel liked the{N}piano.  The ghost may be him.{W1}
3500=Do you know about the stautue{N}of the devil?  It appeared{N}at the Ancient Tower.{W1}
3501=Red Baron was looking for{N}something at the Ancient{N}Tower.{W2}
3502=Nobody returned from that{N}trip.  I didn't go. I was{N}smart!{W1}
3503=I think he was looking for{N}the Holy Sword.{W2}
3504=Please don't tell anybody{N}that I told you.{W1}
3505=I...I saw them...many devils{N}came from the tower....{W1}
3506=Why am I guarding the{N}kitchen?!{W1}
3507=You want to enter the tower?{W2}
3508=Impossible.  It's buried in{N}the ground and there is no{N}door.{W1}
3509=I heard a rumor that a{N}handsome boy is leading{N}the devils now.{W1}
3510=Good weapons and armor, huh?{W1}
3511=A statue of a devil's head.{N}It looks ready to bite you.{W1}
3512=A statue of a fierce{N}devil's head.  There's a{N}slit at its mouth.{W1}
3513=Sir Astral!  {LEADER}!{W1}
3514={LEADER}, wait!{W1}
3515=May I join your force?{W1}
3516=Well...{W1}
3517=You can trust me.{N}I'm a born fighter.{W2}
3518=As you know, I want to die.{W2}
3519=I will die fighting for your{N}cause, if you let me.{W1}
3520=He's a hero in Galam.{N}I think he should join us.{W1}
3521={NAME;28}, please come{N}with us.  You'll be a great{N}help.{W1}
3522=Oh, thank you!  I know I can{N}take the King of the Devils!{W1}
3523={W1}
3524=Remember.  You're our{N}leader.  We lose when you{N}are defeated.  OK?{W1}
3525=(Whinny!)...Oh, I love{N}going into battle!{W1}
3526=Stand at attention!{N}Ready for inspection, sir!!{W1}
3527=Sir Hawel's teachings are{N}very helpful.  Strategy was{N}his cup o' tea.{W1}
3528=I'm like a shadow of the{N}night.  Silent and deadly!{W1}
3529=Speaking...tires me.{N}Fighting...tires me.{N}I'm tired.{W1}
3530=Phoenix don't need a priest.{N}We can revive ourselves.{W1}
3531=I'm a centaur, but I can use{N}a bow and arrows!{W1}
3532=Those who are truly strong,{N}like me, don't need weapons!{W1}
3533=I love swooping in for the{N}kill!{W1}
3534=This is great!  I love this{N}cannon!{W1}
3535=We centaurs are the main{N}fighters in a battle!{N}We're awesome!{W1}
3536=Enemies from the sky are{N}mine.  My arrows will get{N}them!{W1}
3537=I trained a lot when I was{N}younger.  Style is more{N}important than strength.{W1}
3538=I'm not afraid of devils!{N}When's the next battle?{W1}
3539=I'll face any devil, any{N}time!  Bring 'em on!!{W1}
3540=My magic powers should be a{N}great help to you!{W1}
3541=I'm afraid of battle, but{N}I'll never run from the{N}enemy!{W1}
3542=I'm fully recovered!{N}Where's the enemy?{W1}
3543=I'm not as strong as you, so{N}I'll support you from the{N}sky.{W1}
3544=The power of nature is much{N}stronger than the devils!{W1}
3545=I can't forgive them!{N}Evil must be purged from the{N}Earth!{W1}
3546=Why are they so excited?{N}I fight for myself, not for{N}anybody else!{W1}
3547=Dwarves are tough.  Put me{N}in the front of the force!{W1}
3548=Devils, go away!{N}I'll knock you out!{W1}
3549=We have been fighting the{N}devils since the ancient{N}days....{W1}
3550=Magic sure is helpful in a{N}battle, isn't it?{W1}
3551=Like {NAME;7}, I'll{N}never die.  I don't care{N}how difficult the battle is!{W1}
3552=I was created by ancient{N}magic.  It's my destiny{N}to defeat the devils!{W1}
3553={W1}
3554=Have you ever noticed how{N}short {NAME;3} is?{W1}
3555=I'm a lot taller than{N}{NAME;3}.  He, he...(whinny)!{W1}
3556=Ouch...{NAME;1} just told me{N}how short I was....{W1}
3557=Using magic tires me out.{N}I need to rest a lot.{W1}
3558=I'm thinking of a way to{N}steal more treasure after{N}the battle.{W1}
3559=I'm practicing...{N}dodge...dodge....{N}(Whew)...I'm tired!{W1}
3560={LEADER}, do you think I'm{N}a snob?{N}I heard a rumor about me!{W1}
3561=What is Grans like?{N}I'm from the country, so I{N}really like cities!{W1}
3562=Grrrr...Grrrrrrr...is that{N}enough?  I try to be brutal.{W1}
3563=I prefer the battle area to{N}the Caravan.{W1}
3564=The Ancients were so smart!{N}Moving about in a vehicle{N}is wonderful!{W1}
3565={LEADER}, adventuring{N}with you is more exciting{N}than I expected!{W1}
3566=Wow...it sure is nice to{N}rest after a hard battle.{W1}
3567=There are many centaurs in{N}this force, but I think I'm{N}the most valuable one!{W1}
3568={NAME;3} sure is cute,{N}even if he is kinda short.{W1}
3569=Hey, are you crazy?!{N}Put me in battle!{W1}
3570=Young men nowadays are so{N}difficult to understand.{N}Am I getting old...?{W1}
3571=I'm just happy to be with{N}{NAME;13}!{W1}
3572=I can't kill myself.  Why?{N}I'm not a vampire, am I?{W1}
3573=Are you surprised to see how{N}fast I grew?{N}So am I!{W1}
3574=Mitula looks young, but she{N}is actually quite old.{W1}
3575=Blast!{N}This is so exciting!{W1}
3576=I like this!  Free food!{W1}
3577=Travel is my hobby!{N}See this souvenir?{N}It's for my wife, and....{W1}
3578=Let me fight!  C'mon!{N}No one is a match for a{N}master monk!{W1}
3579=(Click, click)...oh, I have{N}to oil my body sometimes.{W1}
3580=Do I behave haughty?{N}They seldom talk to me.{N}(Sob...sob){W1}
3581=Give me your hand...oh, am I{N}still cold?  But, I'm alive.{W1}
3582=They say I'm dirty!  Is it{N}because I've never washed{N}my body before?!{W1}
3583=You're not devils, are you?{W2}
3584=How did you get here safely?{W1}
3585=I'm hungry....{W1}
3586=Are you strong?  Will you{N}please kill the devils?{W1}
3587=Pacalon soldiers are so{N}proud!{W2}
3588=But, they're just cowards{N}that hide in the castle.{W1}
3589=What will we do when we{N}lose?{W1}
3590=Do you know Geshp?{W2}
3591=He sometimes comes here.{N}He seems so friendly.{W2}
3592=Are all devils like him?{N}If so, I like them.{W1}
3593=Do you think Pacalon can{N}beat the devils?{W2}
3594=Say yes!  Pacalon has the{N}best fighters in the world!{W1}
3595=This is Pacalon, a kingdom{N}of fine centaurs.{W2}
3596=We welcome you.{W1}
3597=Rain!  This must be a{N}present from the gods!{W1}
3598=Thanks to the rain, I'm no{N}longer thirsty.{N}But, I'm still hungry.{W1}
3599=Did you save Mitula?{W2}
3600=Then, why don't you defeat{N}those devils?{W1}
3601=Was Tristan occupied by{N}devils?{W2}
3602=That's why we've had no{N}rain lately.{W1}
3603=I see Geshp frequently.{N}He always stares at the{N}castle.{W1}
3604=Unbelievable!  You've{N}finally arrived.{W1}
3605=Creed...I mean, Mr...{W1}
3606=That's OK, {NAME;7}.{N}I doubted you'd ever make{N}it here.{W2}
3607=The enemies you've faced so{N}far were strong.{W1}
3608=Yes, they were.{W1}
3609=Why am I here?  Is that your{N}question, {LEADER}?{W2}
3610=I wanted to help you.{W2}
3611=There is no church around{N}here.  Think of me as a{N}priest.{W1}
3612=Now, what can I do for you?{W1}
3613=Who is it?  Petro?{W1}
3614=Well, who are you?{W1}
3615=Petro?  Is he back?{W1}
3616=Petro!  The Sky Orb is OUR{N}treasure!  Give it back!{W2}
3617=Say something!{N}Petro!{W1}
3618=Oh, you're not Petro.{N}Who...are you?{W1}
3619=Ancient stone?  Yes, my{N}family had it for a long{N}time.{W2}
3620=But, it was stolen.{W1}
3621=His brother, my grandson,{N}took the stone, the Sky Orb,{N}when he left.{W2}
3622=I think he went to Grans{N}Island to operate an ancient{N}vehicle.{W2}
3623=I've lost my purpose to live.{W1}
3624=He spent all his spare time{N}studying the Sky Orb.{W2}
3625=It is quite old.{N}He deduced that our{N}ancestors could fly.{W2}
3626=The last known location of{N}the Nazca Ship was Grans.{W1}
3627=You need my help?{W1}
3628=Come in.  Talk to me.{W1}
3629=I came here looking for{N}ancient treasure, and found{N}the Sky Orb.{W2}
3630=Also, I discovered how to{N}use the ancient tunnels.{W2}
3631=But, most of them are{N}useless, except for the{N}one to Grans.{W1}
3632=To Grans?{W1}
3633=Can we get to Grans Island{N}through it?{W1}
3634=Yes.  Do you want to go{N}there?{W2}
3635=Really?{W2}
3636=You'll go to Grans with me.{N}Let's go now!{W1}
3637={LEADER} decides to go{N}with him.{W1}
3638=All I want is the Sky Orb.{N}Just help me get that, and{N}then you can leave.{W1}
3639=Good luck.{W2}
3640=If you see my brother,{N}please tell him that I'm OK.{W1}
3641=Oh, what a pity.{N}You can't go to Grans.{W1}
3642=It's my job!{W1}
3643=Row...sham...bow!{W1}
3644=OK, you go first!{W1}
3645=I'm Paseran of Ribble.{N}I'm studying the ancient{N}petroglyphs.{W2}
3646={NAME;11} told me about{N}a family who has an ancient{N}tomb in Parmecia.{W2}
3647=According to my studies,{N}his house should be around{N}here somewhere.{W2}
3648=Or, maybe it's to the east.{W1}
3649=I feel...a power returning{N}me to human.{W2}
3650=Hey!  The evil is gone!{N}Did you chase them away?{W1}
3651={LEADER}, who is she?{W1}
3652=Did you say {LEADER}?{N}Oh, you're from Granseal!{W1}
3653=Yes, we are, but who are{N}you?{W1}
3654=Do you know how long I've{N}been here as a stone statue?{W1}
3655=How do you know {LEADER}?{W1}
3656=Oh, I'm sorry.{W2}
3657=I'm {NAME;21}, a sorceress.{N}Goddess Mitula told me about{N}you.{W1}
3658=She did?{W1}
3659=Yes.  She was worried about{N}you.{W2}
3660=You are fated to fight Zeon.{W2}
3661=But, she is unable to help{N}you.  It's an order from{N}Volcanon.{W2}
3662=But, I'm here for her.{N}I'm here to help you.{W1}
3663=You want to go to Grans,{N}right?  Then, I think we{N}can use the ancient ship.{W2}
3664=Let's go to Nazca.{W1}
3665=Arc Valley is a dark place{N}where evil gathers.{W2}
3666=He who rules Arc Valley is{N}the King of the Devils.{W1}
3667=Dark Sol, Dark Dragon and{N}Zeon fought desperately to{N}obtain Arc Valley.{W2}
3668=The fighting of the devil{N}kings created a mighty storm.{W1}
3669=Zeon won.  And every devil{N}named him the King of the{N}Devils.{W2}
3670=The other two kings envied{N}Zeon.  They sealed his powers{N}inside the Jewel of Evil.{W1}
3671=When Zeon lost his powers,{N}he fell to Earth, and created{N}a giant crater when he hit.{W2}
3672=His moan destroyed the{N}mountains and the crater{N}was buried by the debris.{W1}
3673=Grieving over the fight, the{N}God of Wisdom created the{N}Jewel of Light.{W2}
3674=The Jewel of Light chose a{N}brave man and gave him a{N}Holy Sword.{W1}
3675=With the Holy Sword in{N}hand, the brave man fought{N}against the two devil kings.{W2}
3676=The Holy Sword contained{N}holy power.  Thus, the two{N}devil kings were defeated.{W1}
3677=Evil Arc Valley was sealed{N}beneath the Ancient Tower.{W2}
3678=Never open the door to the{N}tower.  A great evil sleeps{N}inside.{W1}
3679=In the event of Zeon{N}awakening, the power of light{N}will choose another.{W2}
3680=Believe us.  We lie not.{N}Attack the devil at his mouth{N}with the Holy Sword.{W1}
3681={LEADER} defeated Red{N}Baron too?  Is that what{N}you said, Geshp?{W1}
3682=Yes, sir...I'm sorry.{W1}
3683=Once again, my minions have{N}failed me.{W2}
3684=Are my soldiers that weak?{W1}
3685=Yes...oh, no!  I mean, they{N}were strong enough.{W2}
3686=But {LEADER} and his force{N}were smarter.{W1}
3687=No more excuses!{W2}
3688=This is your last chance.{N}Kill {LEADER} this time,{N}or I'll kill you!{W1}
3689=Ah...yes, sir.  I'll kill{N}{LEADER} this time.{N}I stake my life on it.{W1}
3690=Bring the Jewel of Evil back{N}to me!{W1}
3691=Yes, sir!{W1}
3692=You were right, Odd Eye.{W1}
3693=Of course.{W1}
3694=I can't trust Geshp anymore.{W2}
3695=If he fails, you must battle{N}{LEADER}.{W1}
3696=You want me to kill{N}{LEADER}?{W2}
3697=He's probably much stronger{N}now.{N}Hmmm, sounds interesting.{W2}
3698=I'll do it.  If this comes{N}to pass, it will be his final{N}battle.{W1}
3699={LEADER} is almost here{N}already?{W1}
3700=Yes, sir.  With an ancient{N}aircraft.  He'll be passing{N}over the cape soon.{W1}
3701=Good.  I'll do anything to{N}get my powers back.{W1}
3702=They're stronger than we{N}thought.{W2}
3703=But, I have an idea.  Please{N}let me try it.{W1}
3704=Well?{W1}
3705=I think it's better for us{N}to shoot them down over the{N}
3706=cape.{W1}
3707=I agree.{W1}

3716=You noticed that too?{W1}
3717=Yes, King Zeon.{W2}
3718=I'm afraid Geshp can't stop{N}{LEADER}'s advance.{W1}
3719=You really think so?{W1}
3720=I was just thinking of{N}{LEADER}'s hidden powers.{W2}
3721=We must never underestimate{N}him.{W1}
3722=Anyway, it will be a{N}fantastic show!  Ha, ha!{W1}

3733=What's that?  I saw a flash{N}of light over there.{W1}

3777=I'm not Galam, you fools!{W1}
3778=Zeon!{W1}
3779=How?!{N}You died!{W1}
3780=Never!{N}You don't know anything{N}about me!{W2}
3781=I can't be killed by the{N}sword.{W2}
3782=All you can do is weaken me.{W1}
3783=Yes, Mitula told us to{N}weaken him!{W2}
3784=I should have remembered{N}that before Elis was{N}captured!{W1}
3785=Y...you fiend!{W1}
3786=Stop!  Do you want me to kill{N}Elis?!{W1}
3787=Scoundrel!{N}We have to save her!{W1}

3791=Get over here, NOW!{W1}
3792=We have no choice....{W1}
3793={LEADER} nods hopelessly.{W1}
3794=That's far enough.{N}Now, phoenix.{W2}
3795=Take the Jewel of Evil{N}from {LEADER}!{W1}
3796=But, we can't remove it.{W1}

3804=Put it in front of me.{W1}

3810=Zeon is reviving.{N}We have to stop him!{W2}
3811=How?  Mitula!  Volcanon!{N}Tell me!{W1}
3812=Ha, ha!  Astral!{N}I'll have revived fully in a{N}few minutes.{W1}

3819=Aauugghhh!{N}I'm burning!{W1}
3820=That is special fire.{N}It burns even vampires!{W1}
3821=NO!{W1}
3822={LEADER} slapped the jewel{N}out of Zeon's hand.{W1}
3823=Ouch, darn you {LEADER}!{W1}
3824=Ohhh....{W1}
3825={LEADER} is stunned.{W1}
3826=That's what you get!{W1}
3827=Groovy!{W1}
3828={NAME;28}...{W1}
3829=What?  How?{W1}

3833=Get away!{W1}
3834=I'll go, but I'll take you{N}with me to another dimension.{W1}
3835=Die!{W1}
3836=King...Galam...{W1}
3837=How?  It's not possible!{W2}
3838=You can't still be alive!{W2}
3839=Oh, my powers are fading.{N}Where's the jewel?!{W1}
3840=My King...come with me....{W1}
3841=No, I'll never go back to{N}such a terrible...{W1}
3842=I shall return!{N}Remember!{W1}
3843=Noooooooooo!{W1}
3844={NAME;28} has taken Zeon{N}away.{W1}
3845=It's over.{W2}
3846=But, what a tragic ending.{W1}
3847={LEADER}?  Is he OK?{W1}
3848={LEADER},  Zeon was{N}taken away by {NAME;28}.{W1}
3849={LEADER} nods.{W1}
3850=Oh, is she...is Princess{N}Elis OK?{W1}
3851=Princess!{W1}
3852={NAME;7} shakes her{N}wildly.{W1}
3853=Elis does not respond.{W1}
3854=She's so cold, and looks so{N}pale.{W2}
3855=Sir Astral, is she dead?{W1}
3856=I don't think so.{N}Let me see her.{W1}
3857=Astral examines Elis.{W1}
3858=No. She's cold, but she's{N}breathing.{W2}
3859=I don't understand....{W1}
3860=She's in a coma.{W1}
3861=Goddess Mitula...?{W1}
3862=Hello, Astral.{N}{LEADER} and {NAME;7},{N}you did very well.{W1}
3863=Mitula!  I knew you would{N}come.{W1}
3864=We've been watching.{W1}
3865=We?  I don't see anybody{N}else?{W1}
3866=C'mon, {NAME;7}.{N}You know what I mean.{W1}
3867=Volcanon?{W1}
3868=Yes.  He helped you many{N}times.{W1}
3869=When?{W1}
3870=You doubt me?{W2}
3871=How about {NAME;28}?{N}God Volcanon protected him{N}from the fire.{W1}
3872=Really?  But he said, he{N}would forsake the people{N}of the earth.{W1}
3873=He said that to deceive the{N}devils.{W2}
3874=If he had joined you at{N}that time, Zeon would've{N}come to Parmecia.{W2}
3875=The entire continent might{N}have been destroyed.{W2}
3876=And if Volcanon had joined{N}you, you would've leaned{N}on him, wouldn't you have?{W1}
3877=The Jewel of Light was made{N}by him, wasn't it?{W2}
3878=It protected {NAME;28}, right?{W1}
3879=You're very smart, Astral.{W1}
3880=I have to go now.{W2}
3881=I need the Jewel of Light.{W1}
3882=Mitula took the Jewel of{N}Light from {LEADER}.{W1}
3883=And I need the Jewel of Evil.{W1}
3884=Mitula took the Jewel{N}of Evil.{W1}
3885=I have to seal Zeon before{N}he regains his power.{W2}
3886=You had better leave now.{N}Arc Valley will be destroyed.{W1}
3887=One more thing!{W1}
3888=Yes?{W1}
3889=How do we wake Elis up?{W1}
3890=She has been poisoned.{W2}
3891=When the poison leaves her{N}body, her face will turn pink.{W1}
3892=Then she will awaken?{W1}
3893=If she's still sleeping, she{N}will need a kiss from her{N}true love.{W2}
3894=This kiss will awaken her.{W1}
3895=When will the poison leave?{W1}
3896=I have no idea.  It depends{N}on her physical strength.{W2}
3897=It may take a few months...{N}or a few years.{W2}
3898=Now, I must go.{N}Good luck.{W1}
3899=She's gone.{W1}
3900=A few years....{W1}
3901=Sir Astral, c'mon!{W2}
3902=Mitula told us to leave.{W1}
3903=Oh, yeah...let's get out of{N}here!{W1}
3904={LEADER}, you carry{N}Princess Elis!{W1}
3905=Oops!  She's sealing the{N}tower!{W1}
3906=Hurry!{W1}
3907={LEADER}, run!{W1}
3908=Two years have passed{N}since Mitula resealed Zeon.{W1}
3909=Wow, is it true?{N}Did Elis' face turn pink?{W1}
3910=Why am I here?{W2}
3911=We have no more enemies.{W1}
3912=Wait, wait!{W2}
3913=Sir Astral told me not to{N}let you go out today!{W2}
3914=You have to be here.{W1}
3915=I envy you.{N}I'm an old woman now.{W2}
3916=Nobody kisses me anymore.{W1}
3917=You're wrong!{W2}
3918=I'll kiss you!{W1}
3919={LEADER}, did you hear?{W2}
3920=The Princess' face turned{N}pink!{W1}
3921=Ah, {LEADER}!{N}I'm so happy!{W2}
3922=I heard Princess Elis is{N}going to awaken today!{W1}
3923=Thanks to Galam and{N}Pacalon, Granseal is{N}now the same as before!{W1}
3924=Galam is making a statue of{N}{NAME;28} as a memorial.{W1}
3925={LEADER}, you...will...{N}kiss...her...?{W2}
3926=I don't like you anymore.{N}(Sigh){W1}
3927=I'm so happy.  I'll get to{N}see Elis again!{W1}
3928={NAME;2} had better not{N}be the one who kisses her.{W2}
3929=If he kisses her, he'll have{N}my hoofprints on his rump!{W1}
3930=I heard a rumor!{N}Are you going to kiss her?{W2}
3931=Shucks, I wish I were as{N}young as you.{W1}
3932=Morning, {LEADER}.{W2}
3933=Are you ready to go to{N}the castle?{W1}
3934=I know somebody must kiss{N}her....{W2}
3935=Who will it be?{N}What will I do if...{N}it's...?{W1}
3936=I don't think it's going to{N}be me 'cause I'm a centaur.{W2}
3937=Who will it be?{N}Does Sir Astral know?{W1}
3938=I will do anything for{N}Princess Elis!!{W2}
3939=I hope Sir Astral chooses{N}me!{W1}
3940=She's no longer poisoned,{N}but she's still asleep.{W2}
3941=And Sir Astral called us{N}here!{N}Who's going to kiss her?{W1}
3942={LEADER}!{W2}
3943=I'm waiting for Sir Astral.{W2}
3944={LEADER}, will you go{N}see him?{W1}
3945={LEADER}, how are you?{W2}
3946=I received an invitation{N}for todays festivities.{W2}

3949=I got an invitation to a{N}wedding party.{N}Who's getting married?{W1}
3950=Granseal is beautiful!{W2}
3951={NAME;2} told me about{N}it, but it's better than I{N}pictured!{W1}
3952=Hello, {LEADER}!{N}You look good!{W2}
3953=The Caravan is working well!{N}I found some more ruins!{N}Ha, ha, ha!{W1}
3954=Sir Astral invited{N}{NAME;7} and I.{W2}
3955=It's hard to believe there{N}was ever a threat of evil!{W1}
3956=King Pacalon asked me to say{N}hello to you.{W2}
3957=He should see this beautiful{N}castle.{W1}
3958=Two years...since that{N}battle....{W2}
3959=I hope {NAME;28} is OK.{W1}
3960=This is wonderful!{W2}
3961={LEADER}, you were{N}younger than the Princess,{N}but now you're older!{W1}
3962=But, age doesn't matter.{W1}
3963={NAME;11} is crazy, but{N}he's the greatest!{W2}
3964=He's living his dream of{N}continuous adventure.{N}{LEADER}, will you join us?{W1}
3965=Why is she still sleeping?{W2}
3966=Astral said he knew who...{W1}
3967=King Granseal, {LEADER}{N}is here!{W1}
3968=Please explain what is{N}happening.{W1}
3969=Yes, sir.{W1}
3970=Listen up!{W2}
3971=It took two years, but the{N}Princess finally recovered{N}from the poison.{W2}
3972=But she's still sleeping.{N}We've decided to take{N}Mitula's advice.{W1}
3973=Mitula...you mean, somebody{N}gets to kiss her?{W1}
3974=Yes.{N}We feel this is the right{N}time.{W1}
3975=And we need to decide which{N}one of you will kiss{N}Elis.{W1}
3976=We don't have to decide.{N}It's {LEADER}.{N}{NAME;10}, don't you agree?{W1}
3977=Ha, ha!  Yes, {NAME;7}!{W2}
3978=I always thought {LEADER}{N}was the best choice!{W1}
3979=Are you sure?{N}Anybody disagree?{W1}
3980=Nobody?{W1}
3981=I understand what my friends{N}are saying, but...I love{N}her.{W2}
3982=May I kiss her?{N}Somebody, say yes!{W1}
3983=Sorry, but...I don't think{N}{NAME;3} is the right{N}choice.{W1}
3984=I understand {NAME;3}, but{N}she is a human.{W2}
3985=A human is the best choice.{W1}
3986={LEADER} is a human!{N}They will make a cute couple!{W1}
3987={LEADER} is a good lad{N}with the manner of a{N}knight!{W2}
3988=I think he's the best{N}choice.{W1}
3989={NAME;1}, what do you{N}think?{W1}
3990=M...me?  Well...{W2}
3991=I'm worried about her...{N}but...I...{W2}
3992=Yes, a good choice....{N}{LEADER} will make her...{N}...happy....{W1}
3993=Does she love {LEADER}?{N}I didn't know that.{W1}

4004=You knew that?{N}{NAME;10}, you're smart.{W2}
